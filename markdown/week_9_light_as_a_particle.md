Lesson Objectives
-----------------

By the end of the week you will be able to

1. Explain the basic physics principles involved in the conversion of solar light into electricity in solar cell technology.
2. Use a potential energy graph to determine the behavior of systems and find the turning points.
3. Understand the photoelectric effect and its physical implications
  1. Describe the experimental setup that leads to the photoelectric effect.
  2. Relate the stopping potential to the kinetic energy of the electron.
  3. Explain the graphs of the current versus frequency and the current versus voltage.
4. Describe Einsteinâ€™s explanation of the photoelectric effect in terms of quantum light.
5. Calculate the energy of a quantum of light (photon) given the frequency.

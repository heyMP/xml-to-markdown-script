<div class="question">Q. TRUE or FALSE?   
In order for John to hear Jill, air molecules must move all the way from the lips of Jill to the ears of John.

1. [True](#)**No.** All the way?
2. [False](#)**Correct!** A sound wave involves the movement of energy from one location to another, not the movement of material. The air molecules are the particles of the medium, and they are only temporarily displaced, always returning to their original position.
 
</div><div class="question">Q. A medium is able to transport a wave from one location to another because the particles of the medium are ____.

1. [frictionless.](#)**No**. on the contrary
2. [isolated from one another.](#)**No**. on the contrary
3. [able to interact.](#)**Correct!** For a wave to be transmitted through a medium, the individual particles of the medium must be able to interact so they can exert a push and/or pull on each other; this is the mechanism by which disturbances are transmitted through a medium.
4. [very light.](#)**No**. does not matter.
 
</div>- M: Good job, Sophie. Remember that a wave is just the disturbance that is traveling. The atoms in the medium in which the wave is (the disturbance) do move a bit, but, on average, they donâ€™t go anywhere.
- S: It makes sense. When I go to the beach, I get waves after waves hitting me, but it's really always the same molecules of water each time.
- M: That's right. Another good example is sound.

Sound 
------

Sound is a disturbance in the pressure of the air.

When you vibrate a tuning fork or a string, you create regions of _compression_ and of _rarefaction_. These are the crests and troughs of the wave.

If you vibrate the guitar string twice as slow (reduce the frequency by two) then the distance between the compressed regions will be twice as big (you would double \(\lambda\)).

Just as for any waves, we have:

\(v_{sound} = \lambda f\)

### Speed of Sound 

What is the speed of a sound wave? When you see lightning outside, it often takes a while to hear the thunder. We saw this already in week 1. The speed of sound at normal temperature and pressure is

1 mile per 5 seconds = 1,000 feet per second = 330 meters per second.   
This is the same speed as the average speed of molecules in air.

- S: I learned last week that if I increase the temperature, I give more kinetic energy to the atoms in the gas. If they have more kinetic energy, then they will move faster... so does that means that sound travels faster on a hot day?
- M: Yes, it does! Pretty cool, isn't it?

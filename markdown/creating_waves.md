Lets create some waves. Try the following applet and create waves of all kind on this string. Make sure to try the pulse button with no damping. You can try to find how to make waves move faster!

The Speed Equation
------------------

- S: So I see that, if I increase the tension in the string, the pulse or wave moves faster (try it out above); but I don't understand why that is...
- M: Good. The key idea is that the speed of a wave is determined by the medium in which it propagates. If you think of a string as a long line of atoms attached by springs, then the higher the tension, the more stiff the springs are. If you displace one atom at one end of the rope, it will pull on its neighbor which will then pull on the next one, etc... The stiffer the springs are (the higher the tension), the faster the disturbance will travel.
- S: Hmmm I see.
- M: Here is another simple (but super important) equation.

Starting from

1. wavelength \(\lambda\) = (distance)/(oscillation): The wavelength is the distance traveled per oscillation or cycle.
2. Frequency f = (Oscillation)/(time): The frequency is the number of oscillation you do per unit of time. (usually in Hz so per second).

one gets:

(Wavelength)(frequency) = (distance)/(time) = speed v

or speed of wave \(v = \lambda f\). There is a subtle point here that the speed v is determined by the medium. The speed is usually constant. The wavelength and frequency are the things that adjust themselves such that the product always equals v.

Example:

<div class="question">Q. Let us say that I double the pitch of a note (sound wave). What happens to the speed of the wave?

1. [It doubles.](#)**No.** Not quite, think again
2. [It halves.](#)**No.** Not quite, think again
3. [It stays the same.](#)Indeed, it stays the same. This is a sound wave and the waves travel at the speed of sound. The speed of sound can vary from place to place and with changes in temperature, but it does not change just because you double the pitch of your note. If you double the pitch and oscillate your vocal chords twice as fast, then you will reduce the distance between crests by half. So the wavelength will be reduced by two in such a way that \(\lambda f = v\) as before.

The article you just read on the LHC is a good ethics case study, so let's look at it a little bit more. In your homework after the midterm, I will ask you for some moral options of what the scientists should do.

Imagine we are two years before the official date when the LHC will turn on. Some new theories by respected scientists are now claiming that the LHC may be able to produce small black holes. Some people are protesting and want to shut down the accelerator because they claim there is a chance, probably small but still there, that the world will be destroyed.

The questions are twofold:

- Did the scientists take all the proper care needed to ensure the safety of the planet? What should they do next?
- A more general question is the following: The experiment is huge and very, very, very expensive. Is this is a good use of money?

Some Facts to Orient Your Thinking
----------------------------------

1. It took 14 years to build the LHC. It ended up costing 8 billions dollars.
2. This is a multi-country collaboration. (Who is responsible?)
3. The goal was to find a new particle called the Higgs, but anything could happen; we don't know the new physics that we are about to uncover.
4. There were two published safety reports before this new lawsuit.
5. CERN (where the LHC is) is being accused of flawed previous safety reviews.
6. CERN is being accused of not adhering to the Precautionary Principle.
7. A new worry is black holes, which nobody thought was even a possibility until a few years ago. This worry appeared when the LHC was almost finished and all financed.

Values
------

The values involved in this ethical decision are:

1. Do no harm
2. Scientific honesty

Possible Consequences of Various Actions
----------------------------------------

1. Destruction of the Earth
2. Stop fundamental physics research and slow down progress
3. Money could be saved to give food to hungry people.
4. etc.

So, what would you do as a scientist? Assume you are at the juncture where the LHC is almost done but it may pose a new threat to humanity. What would you do?

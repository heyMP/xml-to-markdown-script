<div class="column small-6 medium-4 large-2 right">[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=409|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right]</div>- Electricity is an interaction between charged objects. The electron has negative charge -e and the proton has positive charge +e. Where \(e = 1.602\times10^{-19}\) Coulombs.
- Most of the time, the electrons are the particles moving in an electric current. In addition to their charge, electrons have a mass of 0.5 MeV/\(c^2\). The eV is a unit for energy, which is just the charge e times 1 volt. 1 eV = \(1.602 \times 10^{-19}\) Joules. 1 MeV is one mega electron volt or (\(10^6\) eV).
- Each charged object generates an electric field everywhere in space.
- Given a picture of the electric field. You should be able to determine where the force is stronger and in which direction it is. The magnitude of the electric force is the charge times the magnitude of the electric field \(F = q E\). If the charge is negative, the force will be in the opposite direction as the E field.
- You should know what a conductor, a capacitor, and a battery are. Understand the water tower analogy.

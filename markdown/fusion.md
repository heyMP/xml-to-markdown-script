<div class="question">Q. **_Optional harder question_**: The ground state energy for electrons in an atom is around 1 eV (13.6 eV for hydrogen for example). **What do you think the ground state energy for alpha particles in a nucleus should be?** To figure this out, you just need to know the difference in size and the fact that the ground energy \(E_1 \propto \frac{1}{m L^2}\). An atom is \(10^{-10}\) m in size while the nucleus is \(10^{-15}\) meters in size. The mass of the alpha partcle is about \(10^4\) times bigger than the electron.

1. [10 eV](#).  
  **No.** Too small.
2. [\(10^6\) eV](#).  
  **Correct.** The size of nucleus is \(10^5\) smaller. Since the energy goes like \(1/L^2\), the smaller the size of the box the bigger the energy. Here by a factor of \(10^{10}\) because of the square. But the energy is reduced by how much bigger the mass of the alpha particle is. So instead of \(10^{10}\), we have \(10^6\). Note that \(10^6\) eV is 1 mega eV (1 MeV) and this is the order of magnitude of the average binding energy of nucleon inside a nucleus.
3. [\(10^{12}\) eV.](#)**No.** Too big.
4. [\(10^{20}\) eV](#).  
  **No.** Too big.

Would work if we use c as the speed of the proton, but why do that?

Speed of electroon is about alpha c. Can we say that nucleus and electron have the same p??

<div class="question">Q. Is it a good approximation to neglect the wavelike nature of the nucleus? Consider an helium nucleus with 2 protonts and 2 neutrons (\(m=4\times 1.7\times 10^{-27}\) kg).

1. [Show answer](#)  
  Just to get an idea of the size of the wave, we can use the de Broglie formula \(\lambda = \frac{h}{p}\). This formula should only be used for freely moving particle with no potential energy but we just want to know roughly the size of the wave. So lets consider Helium gas. The speed of atoms in a gas is the speed of sound of about 340 m/s. This should be roughly the same as the speed of the nucleus. Therefore the momentum is \(p = mv \approx 6.8 \times 10^{-27} \times 340 = 2.3 \times 10^{-24}\) kg m/s. Using that Planck's constant is \(h = 6.6 \times 10^{-34}\) J s, we find that the wavelength of the nucleus wavefunction is about \(\lambda = 2.9 \times 10^{-10}\) m.

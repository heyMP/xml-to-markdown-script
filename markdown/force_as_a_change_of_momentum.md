Instead of talking about velocity and acceleration, we can reframe the whole discussion around momentum. This is in fact a better (and more correct) way to think about forces.

Remember that momentum is something that all particles and waves have. The low speed formula (low compare to the speed of light) for momentum is just:

\( p = mv\)

which is just mass times velocity.

Let us now rephrase the first two of Newton's laws in term of momentum.

1. **If there is no force acting on particle/wave, the momentum remains the same**. The particle keeps moving in the same direction with the same velocity and the same momentum. So in the absence of forces, momentum is unchanged.
2. **If a force acts on a particle it changes its momentum**. A constant force F applied over an interval of time \(\Delta t\) changes the momentum by the amount

\( F\Delta t = \Delta p\)

The unit for force is called the Newton (N).

This is one part of the class where you are expected to be able to do some numerical computation. Look carefully at the example below.

<div class="question">Q. A car has a mass of 1000 kg and it is going at a velocity of 20 m/s (positive so to the right). The driver sees an animal on the road and she is able to suddenly break to a stop in 20 seconds with a constant breaking force. What must the breaking force be?

1. [100 N](#)Not enough!
2. [- 2000 N](#)Not quite. 2000 kg m/s is the change in momentum.
3. [- 1000 N](#)Correct! To find the force, you first find the change in momentum \(\Delta p = p_f - p_i\). The final momentum is zero because the car stops so \(p_f =0\). The initial momenta is \(p_i = m v = (1000\;kg) \times (20\;m/s) = 20,000\; kg\;m/s\).  
    
  So the change in momenta is \(\Delta p =p_f -p_i= -20,000 \;kg\;m/s\). **The minus sign is important.**  
    
  The force is then given by dividing the change in momentum by the interval of time (20 seconds). This gives a force of \(F = (-20,000\;kg\;m/s)/(20\;s) = - 1000\;N\).  
    
  The unit for force is the Newton N and the sign indicates that the force must be to the left to make the car break!
4. [1000 N](#)No. Is the force to the left or the right?

</div>The relationship \( F\Delta t = \Delta p\) tell us something important about how we can make a force bigger or smaller by changing the time over which the force act. Look carefully at the next question.

<div class="question">Q. Let's say you jump from the roof and collide with the parkway. In order to reduce damage and reduce the force on your knees, do you want the collision to last a long time or a short time?

1. [Long time collision](#)**Correct!** Indeed, the change in momentum is the same (you go from some speed to zero, and your mass arguably didn't change...). The longer the time the smaller the average force will need to be. Time \* Force is change in momentum. This is why it is good to roll when you fall on the ground.
2. [Short time collision](#)**No**. That will hurt even more
3. [Does not matter](#)**No**. It does matter.

</div>**To summarize, in the absence of any forces, I keep moving with the same momentum. If someone exerts a force on me over a certain amount of time, then my momentum will change.**

But momentum is really conserved. Like energy, no momentum is ever created or destroyed in the Universe, it just moves around. So it is not really a change in momentum. It is more of an **exchange** of momentum between two (or more) entities. And this observation is the basis for Newton's third law.

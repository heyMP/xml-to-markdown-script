(Electrostatic) Potential Energy
--------------------------------

Before we look into more details of the photoelectric effect, let us have a look at the main tool we will be using to analyze the behavior of the electron. This is the **potential energy graph**.

- S: Can somebody remind me again what is potential energy?
- B: Sure, there is a potential energy for each force. Right now, the only force you have studied is the electric force which, as you remember, is the charge q times the electric field (not energy) \(F=qE\).
- S: Yes I remember that.
- B: Ok, well another way to think about the force is in term of electric potential energy \(U\). Think of the electric potential energy as being a roller-coaster like we saw in week 2 (see Fig. 2). This potential energy is everywhere in space (just like the electric field) and you can find the force on a particle by simply looking at the **slope** of the potential. The steeper the slope, the stronger the electric force.

Suppose an electron feels the following potential energy in some direction x (as shown in Fig. 3).

<div class="question">Q. Where is the force the biggest to the left? Remember the slope of U determine the magnitude of the force.

2. [B](#)**No.**
3. [C, D, E](#)**No.**
4. [F](#)**No.**
5. [G](#)**Correct!** Indeed this is where the slope is the steepest pointing to the left.

1. [A](#)**No.**
2. [B](#)**No.**
3. [C, D, E](#)**Correct!** Indeed. Points C, D, and E have zero slopes. We call those special places on the energy graph, equilibrium points since at those points, there is no force.
4. [F](#)**No.**
5. [G](#)**No.**

</div>Total Energy
------------

The total energy of an electron and proton under the effect of an electric force with electric potential energy \(U_e\) is just potential + kinetic.

\(E_{tot} = K+U_e\).

### Turning Points

Turning points are simply points in space where the particle has no more kinetic energy and must either stop or turn back. To find turning points, you can just draw a horizontal line on the energy graph at the value of the total energy. The turning points are where the total energy is equal to the potential energy (kinetic energy is zero) (see Fig. 4).

![showing the turning points](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/turningpoints1.png "Fig. 4. If you draw a line of total energy on a potential energy graph, the places where the line intersect U are called turning points. At those places in space, the total enegy is equal to the potential and therefore the kinetic energy is zero. ")

Sometimes the particles could be in different regions of space but do not have enough energy to access some other regions. They are trapped in one well and cannot escape to the nearby well. (see Fig. 5).

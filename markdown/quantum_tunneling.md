Discuss the mechanism of quantum tunneling and how it is necessary for alpha radiation.

Why do nuclei decay? The alpha particles inside of a nucleus are bound to it. Why would a nucleus randomly eject an alpha particle?

The key, as always, is quantum mechanics. The alpha particle is described by a wavefunction and, while it is stuck inside the energy well of the nucleus, the wave has a tail outside such that once in a while the alpha particle is found outside of the box. When that happens, we say the nucleus has undergone **alpha decay**. The act of getting out of the box because your wavefunction has a tail outside of it is called **quantum tunneling**. You are tunneling thru the box to escape.

Here is a little teaser video from minutephysics about quantum tunneling.

Going Through a Barrier
-----------------------

When a wave hits a barrier, it stops, but not suddenly. If you look inside of the barrier (see Fig 5), the wave is not oscillating and its amplitude is dropping very fast. Nevertheless, if the barrier has some finite width, the wave will reach the other side with a small but non-zero amplitude.

Inside the barrier, the energy is lower and the amplitude of the wave decreases. But not fast enough, part of the wave survives and remains on the right side of the barrier.")

The main effect of this is that waves can go through walls. A little bit.

- S: Is this why I can hear sound thru walls?
- A: Not really. We meant energy walls, not actual house walls.
- S: Ok but why do I hear thru walls then?
- A: well I guess the wall vibrates and also you hear through holes in the wall like doors and it spreads from there.

In the two animations below you can see what happens when a wave hits a barrier. Some part of it is reflected while the rest goes through (it is transmitted).

In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction tells you where you may find the particle. So because of this quantum tunneling, it is possible to find the particle on the other side of the wall.

<div class="question">Q. Look at the following two barriers potential. Which one would it be easier to tunnel thru?

1. [![](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W10QM3nuclear/widebarrier.png)](#)**No.** Too wide
2. [![](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W10QM3nuclear/thinbarrier.png)](#)**Correct.** The thinner the barrier, the easier it is to tunnel thru.

- You can look at the following [PHET simulation](http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/quantum-tunneling) to play around with quantum tunneling. This is a complicated simulation with many things you can play with. For this class, you should just get a feeling of what happens when you play with the size and width of a single barrier.

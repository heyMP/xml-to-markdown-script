Light as a Photon: How Could that Work?
---------------------------------------

- A: All right, Sophie, come into our world.
- B: Imagine that light is made of photons and let's revisit what Marie showed you earlier: partial reflection, thin films, and the 2-slit experiment.
- S: Ok.

Partial Reflection
------------------

Imagine the setup shown below (Fig 8). We have a light source of a given color (say, red). We emit 100 photons toward a block of glass. Four are reflected and detected by Alice, while 96 are transmitted and detected by Bob inside the glass.

Partial reflection. Some photons must decide to be reflected while others go through. How do they decide which way to go?")

- B: Already, we have a problem, Sophie. How does a photon make up its mind about whether to be reflected or to go through? In the case above, 4% of the photons are reflected while 96% go through. Why? All the photons are identical.
- S: Maybe the glass is made of holes that let most of the photons pass through, but not all.
- A: Yes, you can try theories like that (and Newton, who believed that light was made of particles, tried), but ultimately they fail.
- S: But aren't you both saying that light is made of particles?
- A: Yes, but the problem is that these "particles" must behave very differently from billiard balls.
- B: Here, Sophie. Partial reflection is pretty mysterious if the photon moves like normal particles, but maybe we could come up with an explanation. Partial reflection by two surfaces, on the other hand, is completely mind-boggling.

<div></div>Thin Film Interference from photons??
-------------------------------------

We now have the same setup as before, but the piece of glass is thin and Bob is detecting on the other side. Now by changing slightly the thickness of the glass, Alice detects anywhere between 0 and 16 photons! (see Fig 9).

![same setup as before but not the glass is thin and bob is detected after the photon goes through the whole piece. By varying slightly the thickness of the glass, the number of photon detected by Alice can change from 0 to 16. (100 to 84 for Bob)](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/thinfilmphotonscorrect.png "Fig 9: Thin film. Sometimes Alice (A) detects 0 photons, sometime she detects 16 photons depending on the thickness of the thin film. How do photons adjust their reflection behavior based on the thickness? ")

<div class="question">Q. **How could that be?** If the photon is a normally behaved particle and we know that 4 % of incoming photons gets reflected off the glass, what is the expectation for the number of photons detected by Alice?

1. [4](#)**No.**
2. [0](#)**No.**
3. [8 or a little less.](#)**Correct!**
  
  Let's see. At the first surface, we have 100 photons, 96 go through and 4 are reflected. On the second surface, 4% of 96 should be reflected; that's about 3.84 photons, or about 4 photons. So Alice should detect 8, maybe 7, photons, while Bob will detect 92.
  
  But sometimes Alice detects no photon or 16, twice as much! How can that be?
  
  It's like if the photons know about the second surface. If the second surface is a certain distance away, the photons do not reflect from surface 1. If surface number 2 is a little farther away, then we double the reflection rate. Isn't that strange?
4. [16 or a little less.](#)**No.** This is what Alice sometimes sees, but this is not the expectation if the photon is normal.

</div>### 

### To summarize.

It looks like the photons check how far surface 2 is before deciding to reflect or not from surface 1. It is as if the photons are extended in space somehow.

In fact, the photon propagates in space like a wave. One can say that the wave "associated" with a given photon is a wave with a frequency equal to the energy of the photon divided by _h_

\(f = E/h\).

This is exactly Einstein's relation!

Let us now look at the double slits experiments where we were able to detect each photon individually as they landed on a screen.

For this course we recommend the minimum World Campus technical requirements. If you need technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the [World Campus HelpDesk](http://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/technical-support/contact-us "Outreach HelpDesk home page"). You will need to have a JAVA plug-in order to run the PHET simulation for the virtual labs. Due to security considerations, we recommend to deactivate the Java plug-in after each use.

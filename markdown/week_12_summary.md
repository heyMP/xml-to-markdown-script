- When a wave is confined or constrained, only a discrete set of vibration modes are allowed. These are called standing waves. For the case of a string of length L pinned at both ends, or a tube, the wavelengths are

\(\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}\)

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . where n is the harmonic number.

- An electron has a wavefunction \(\psi\) associated with it. The intensity of the wavefunction tells us where we have more chances of finding the electron.
- When the electron is confined, its wavefunction shows standing wave patterns and the wavelength of the electron wavefunction is quantized.
- This leads (via de Broglie's relationship) to a quantization of the momentum and the energy.
- For an electron in a box, the energy levels go like the harmonic number squared.
- An electron in a hydrogen atom is also stuck in a box. We denote a bound electron to have negative total energy (K+U) while, if the electron has positive energy, it can escape.
- Quantization of energy in an atom means that only certain photons will be absorbed or emitted by atoms.
- These spectral lines are unique to each atom and are used to identify them.
- Quantization of energy explains insulator, which have a "band gap" where there is no electron at the right energy to conduct electricity.
- Semiconductors have a small band gap and, with the right push, they can be transformed from insulator to conductors.
- The transistor is the most important machine in electronics. Its main use is as a valve. A small input voltage turns the valve on and lets a large current flow through.

Up to now we looked at traveling waves. These are waves that are moving in a specific direction; but sometimes waves are stuck and don't move. We call those waves _standing waves_. A good example is the wave you get on the string of a guitar (Fig. 1).

<div>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1030|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]</div>When you pluck the string on a guitar, it vibrates, but, because the string is attached at both ends, you are restricted in which pattern of vibration you can establish (see Fig. 2). Places on the string which never move (like the two ends) are called nodes. In Fig. 3, you can see the first two harmonics (the first two notes) on a guitar string.

This is analogous to standing waves on a string, except that sound is a wave of pressure and the two ends of the tube are places where the pressure never changes. (These are the nodes.)

\*\* Note: You can tell which harmonic it is by counting the number of antinodes, which are the places where the amplitude is at its maximum.

### Explanation Follow-up

The upshot and most important thing to remember is that only a specific set of wavelengths are allowed on a string (or in a tube open at both sides). For a string or tube of length L, the possible wavelengths are given by the formula

\(\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}\)

for n = 1, 2, 3, ....

So, for example, the first harmonic, the fundamental, has a wavelength equal to \(\lambda_1 = 2L.\) This makes sense since as you can see from Fig. 3, the first harmonic looks like half a wavelength on the whole string.

<div class="question">Q. Blow over a straw and then cut it in half and blow again. What happens to the pitch?

1. [It increases.](#)**Correct!** L decreases, so the wavelength of the mode (whichever one we were exciting) decreases. That means the frequency increases and thus the pitch increases.
2. [It decreases.](#)**No**. The other way around.
3. [It remains the same.](#)**No**. The pitch does change.
4. [Can't tell.](#)**No**.

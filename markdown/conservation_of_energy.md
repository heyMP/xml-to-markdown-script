- M: All right, we are wrapping up our quick tour of energy.
- S: It still feels pretty mysterious.
- M: Hopefully, it will become less and less weird as we return frequently to the subject. You should think of energy as something that every particle has and that is associated with its movement or can induce the particle to move.
- M: And, of course—you may have heard this already—energy is conserved.
- S: Yes I did hear this before as some great physics principle.
- M: Well it is. It is a law of physics that we have verified experimentally many times. It says that energy changes form but it is always conserved.

Think for example of a skater. When she is up the ramp, she has some amount (in Joules, say) of gravitational potential energy. As she reaches the bottom of the ramp, she will convert that energy from gravitational potential to kinetic energy. This is really well illustrated in the [following simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/energy-skate-park-basics/latest/energy-skate-park-basics_en.html). Make sure to toggle the pie chart and the bar chart to see how energy is converted from kinetic to gravitational potential energy. You can download the Java file from the [Phet website](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/energy-skate-park-basics).

Conservation of energy is the statement that the total energy (gold bar) of the whole system remains constant in a closed system. The total energy remains the same but note how the energy change form between kinetic and potential.

You can also include friction - click on the friction button at the bottom. In this case, the skater eventually stops after all the kinetic and gravitational potential energy has been converted to thermal energy. (The contact between the wheels and the ramp causes heat and dissipates the energy in the system.)

Energy of the whole system is still conserved, though, even with friction; it us just that now it is in the form of thermal energy (and therefore completely useless—and unusable—to the skater).

\*\*Make sure to play with the simulations; we will come back to this. Test your understanding with the following question:

<div class="question">Q. A skateboarder skates along a ramp shaped like a “W” starting at point A, as shown below. **Which of the following energy diagrams correctly describes his energy at point C?** Note that \(U_g\) refers to gravitational potential energy while K is kinetic energy. You should assume/define that at point B all energy is kinetic (no gravitational energy there). Click on the image that you believe is the right answer.

1. [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=440|entity_type=node|render=link|field=field_image|text=Skateboarder Answer 1|delta=0|item_type=image|alt=Skateboarder Answer 1|width=105|height=70]**Correct!.** Point C is below midpoint. We are assuming (or defining) that at the bottom all energy is kinetic (point B) while at the top we started at rest (so point A, energy is all gravitational \(U_g\)). Point C is below the midpoint so most of the potential energy \(U_g\) was transferred to Kinetic K but not all.
2. [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=441|entity_type=node|render=link|field=field_image|text=Skateboarder Answer 2|delta=0|item_type=image|alt=Skateboarder Answer 2|width=100|height=57]**No!** Point C is below the midpoint. It should have less gravitational potential energy than kinetic energy.
3. [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=442|entity_type=node|render=link|field=field_image|text=Skateboarder Answer 3|delta=0|item_type=image|alt=Skateboarder Answer 3|width=68|height=57]**No**, the skater is moving at point C and must have some kinetic energy.
4. [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=443|entity_type=node|render=link|field=field_image|text=Skateboarder Answer 4|delta=0|item_type=image|alt=Skateboarder Answer 4|width=75|height=63]**No** As we said in the description of the problem. All energy is kinetic at point B, not point C.

Relative Velocity 
------------------

Imagine a train car moving with velocity \(v_T\) of 2 m/s (this is 2 meters per second). Inside there is a cart moving at \(v_C = 1\;m/s\). Still inside the cart there is a ball moving at \(v_B= 4\;m/s\). See Fig. 2

<div class="question">Q. What is the speed of the ball?

1. [4 m/s](#)**No.** Why?
2. [7 m/s](#)**No.** Why?
3. [1 m/s](#)**No.** Why?
4. [Not enough info](#)**Correct!** The question is not precise—velocity with respect to what? Read more to see how the question should have been asked.
 
</div>Velocity With Respect To? 
--------------------------

Imagine a train car moving with velocity \(v_{TG}= 2\;m/s\) **_with respect to the ground_**. Inside there is a cart moving at \(v_{CT} = 1\;m/s\) **_with respect to the train_**. Still inside the cart there is a ball moving at \(v_{BC}= 4\;m/s\) **_with respect to the cart_**.

Velocities are always measured with respect to something. We call the viewpoint "the observer" even though that does not mean there is an actual human there. So we would say that the velocity of the train, as seen by an observer on the ground, is 2 m/s. The notation is important to know:

\( v_{TG} = v_{\rm{train(T)\;with\;respect\;to\;ground(G)}}\)

\( v_{CT} = v_{\rm{cart(C)\;with\;respect\;to\;train(T)}}\)

<span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">The choices of symbols C, T, B. G are arbitrary; you just choose whatever you want.</span>

- M: Note that, if you reverse the order, you just reverse the sign of the speed.
- S: What do you mean?
- M: For example, we know that the train is moving at 2 m/s to the right with respect to an observer on the ground \(v_{TG}\) . If we want to have the velocity of the ground as seen by an observer on the train, we just reverse the subscript and the sign <nobr>\(v_{GT}\) </nobr> and this is –2 m/s. This is the velocity of the ground with respect to the train. This just means that the ground is moving at 2 m/s to the left, as seen from someone on the train.
- S: Oh like when I am on the bus. I see the trees and sign post moving to the back of the bus.
- M: That's right—the trees have a velocity with respect to you.

<div class="question">Q. So, Sophie, going back to the original question: Do you think you can figure out the **velocity of the cart with respect to the ground \(v_{CG}\)?** I remind you that the train is moving with velocity \(v_{TG}= 2\;m/s\) _with respect to the ground_ while the cart is moving at \(v_{CT} = 1\;m/s\) _with respect to the train._

1. [3 m/s](#)**Correct!** This is indeed the most logical answer. At low speed (\* as we will see Enstein changed the picture a bit) we indeed just add the speed together and the trick to knowing the sign and which speed to use is to remember that the indices are always of the following form \( v_{CG} = v_{CT}+ v_{TG}\)   
    
  Note that the subscript on the right disappears with the one on the left of the   
  second term. This is always how it works. For three observers (A, B and C) we always have   
  that   
    
  \(v_{AB} = v_{AC} + v_{CB}\)   
    
  the observer C "disappeared."
2. [1 m/s](#)**No.** Not quite, what would be the most logical answer?
3. [0 m/s](#)**No.** Not quite, what would be the most logical answer?
4. [-2 m/s](#)**No.** Not quite, what would be the most logical answer?
 
</div>- S: Whoa, this is kind of confusing, velocity with respect to...
- M: Take a break, catch your breath! The main point to remember is simple: To describe motion, you have to tell me about an observer. You have to tell me with respect to what.
- S: Ok. Are we always going to use that notation with two subscripts?
- M: No; in fact, we rarely care about changing point of view and will work in a specific reference frame. In fact, we often don't bother to mention with respect to what things are measured, since it is often obvious.
- S: Yes, the speed of a car is always meant to be with respect to the ground.
- M: Exactly. In physics we measure things in the lab reference frame. The observer is whoever is doing the lab!

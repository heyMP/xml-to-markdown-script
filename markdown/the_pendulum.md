Before we study waves, we need to start by looking at the basic idea of **oscillators**. You can get an oscillating behavior (in time) whenever there is a restoring force that wants to continuously bring back the system to equilibrium.

Oscillations are defined by two main quantities: the amplitude and the frequency. The amplitude is the measure of how large the displacement is from equilibrium while the frequency is the number of cycles per second. The unit of frequency is one over second \(1/s\) or Hz (Hertz). We often use the period \(T=1/f\) which is just the inverse of the frequency. It has units of second(s) and it represents the time for one full oscillation. **_Be careful, one full oscillation is one full back and forth._**

A mass oscillating (vibrating) on a spring has a regular frequency. The pendulum swinging back and forth in a grandfather clock is also an oscillator with a specific frequency.

The oscillatory behavior of a pendulum or a mass on a spring is shown in Fig 5. Note the axis, time is the horizontal axis.

There is a lot of information that you need to be able to pick up from this graph:

- Amplitude \(x_m =\frac12 (x_{max} â€“ x_{min})\)
- Period T = time to repeat oscillation (e.g., peak to peak)
- Frequency f = 1/T. This is the number of oscillations per seconds. The units for frequency are Hertz.

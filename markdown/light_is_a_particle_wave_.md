Explaining the Photoelectric Effect
-----------------------------------

Let's say that, for a given metal, it costs \(E_0\) of energy to escape (to get out of the swimming pool). This minimum escape energy is often called the work function. This number is specific to each metal. When an electron absorbs a photon, it gets \(E=hf\) of energy. To get out, this absorbed energy must be greater than \(E_0\); we therefore have a threshold of frequency \(f_0\)

\(E_{absorbed} = h f > E_0\)

Threshold frequency is therefore \(f_0= E_0/h\)

<div class="question">Q. To escape zinc you need about twice as much energy as you need to escape sodium. If to escape zinc you needed ultraviolet light (about 800 THz where THz is Tera Hertz which is \(10^{12}\) Hz), what color do you need to escape sodium?

1. [Blue 668–789 THz](#)**No.** Not quite.
2. [Green 526–606 THz](#)**No.** Not quite.
3. [Yellow 508–526 THz](#)**No.** Not quite.
4. [Orange 484–508 THz](#)  
  **No.** Not quite.
5. [Red 400–484 THz](#)**Correct!** Red, indeed. Half the energy, so half the frequency. The simple formula of Einstein is that E and f are proportional.
 
</div>So the photon theory of Einstein explains the threshold of frequency easily. The fact that the intensity is proportional to current also makes sense. The more intense the light, the more photons we have, the more electrons will be ejected, and the bigger the current.

![x axis is frequency, y axis is kinetic energy of electron. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/Photoelectric_effect_diagramModified.png "Fig 12: With the idea of a quantum particle of light, Einstein predicted that the stopping potential should vary with frequency. This was verified later on and Einstein was rewarded with a Nobel prize for his discovery.")The fact that the stopping potential is independent of intensity can also be explained. The stopping potential is equal to the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. The kinetic energy of the electron after they get out of the metal is whatever extra energy they had above \(E_0\).

\(K = hf - E_0 = e V_{stop}\)

As you can see from this simple formula, the stopping potential only depends on \(E_0\) which is different for each metal and on the frequency of the shining light f. It _does not_ depend on the intensity.

So, with this simple hypothesis for light as a photon, Einstein was able to explain all the strange features of the photoelectric effect. Einstein also predicted something new that had not been measured. He predicted that the stopping potential should increase linearly with f. This was subsequently verified as you can see in Fig 12 which shows kinetic energy (written as \(e V_{stop}\)) as a function of frequency.

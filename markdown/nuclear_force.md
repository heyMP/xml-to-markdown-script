The denser the cloud, the more chance we have of finding the electrons there. The units are a measure of distance. 1 A is one angstrom which is about 10 to the -10 meters. ")

- Bob: Hello, Sophie. We are nearing the end of our exploration of the quantum world. What do you think of it all?
- S: Pretty strange but not that complicated.
- B: Indeed, it all rests on the following pillar.

All 'particles' are represented by a wavefunction whose intensity tells us the probability of finding that particle at a particular location.

- B: If the particle is contained in a small area. The wavefunction must be a standing wave and then only some quantized set of wavelengths or energies are allowed. The cloud model of the atom (see Fig. 1) shows the wavefunction of the electron.

Nucleus
-------

The most important properties of atoms have to do with their electrons, and this is what chemistry is about. We have seen that the quantization of energy of those electrons leads to atomic spectra, to band-gap in solids, and, ultimately, to all of the high tech in our world. ![Nuclear reaction](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W10QM3nuclear/NuclearReaction.png)

One important aspect that we have not yet seen is the nucleus. We have treated the nucleus as a point particle even though it really should be described by a wave just like the electron.

I remind you that the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. The protons repulse each other because of electricity. In order to overcome that repulsion, there must be an attractive force. This is the nuclear force and it acts equally between protons and neutrons.

The attractive nuclear force between nuclei has the following properties.

- It is short range. It drops quickly outside of the nucleus.
- The nuclear force is the same between protons and neutrons but because protons repulse each other due to the electric force, the combination of nuclear + electric force makes the attraction between protons slightly weaker than between neutrons.

Radiation
---------

The protons/neutrons inside of the nucleus are very much like the electrons inside the atom. You can think of them as particles that are bound inside of a potential energy well.

So, just like an atom can emit light from electrons undergoing transitions between different energy levels, a nucleus can also emit radiation. And often nuclear radiation can be pretty harmful. The three main dangerous nuclear rays are show in Fig 2.

![The three main nuclear rays are alpha, beta and gamma radiation. Alpha radiation is blocked by paper while beta will be block by a metal. Gamma is harder to stop and require a big piece of lead. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W10QM3nuclear/Alfa_beta_gamma_radiation_penetration.svg_.png "Fig 2: The three main nuclear rays are alpha, beta and gamma radiation. Alpha radiation is blocked by paper while a thin metal will block beta-rays. Gamma is harder to stop and requires a big piece of lead.")

1. **Alpha radiation:** This is really a helium atom without any electrons (it is doubly ionized).
2. **Beta radiation:** This is just an electron (or sometimes a positron, the anti-particle). _We will not discuss this type of radiation in this class._ It happens when a neutron decides to transform into a proton. This transformation is possible (although rare) and in the process, an electron is ejected. We call this a beta-ray.
3. **Gamma radiation**. This is a photon (light) of wavelength of about \(10^{-12}\) m or frequency of about \(10^{20}\) Hz. So this is a highly energetic photon.

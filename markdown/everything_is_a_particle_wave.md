What is so special about light? How is it that light is not really a particle, not really a wave, but is, instead, some kind of dual quantity? Some strange "particle-wave."

Well, nothing is special about light. Every particle in the world is a "particle-wave."

- <span>S: Really, wouldn't that be very noticeable?</span>
- B: Well, first, we are talking about very small individual particles. In large groups, the wave nature gets "washed out," and the reason for that is simple: there is continuously something interacting with a very large object. And whenever any object interacts it does so as a particle.
- S: Soâ€”you mean that all the air molecules that bounce on me ensure that I remain a particle?
- B: This is part of the reason. There is also the fact that the wave for massive objects has a very, very small wavelength. Let us discuss this.

<span>So, for light we have seen that the relationship between the particle and the wave is that the energy of the particle is directly related to the frequency of the light!</span>

\(E = hf\)

For particles with a mass, a more general relationship was proposed by Louis de Broglie, and it is

\( \lambda = \frac{h}{p}\)

For a massless particle like the photon we have that \(E=pc\) (remember [week 5](https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/phys010/week5_fall16)) and you can check (using that \(c = \lambda f\) that the de Broglie relationship is the same as Einstein's. But for massive particles the momentum is \( p= mv\) (at "low" speed w.r.t. _c_). So the de Broglie wavelength is

\( \lambda = \frac{h}{mv}\)

The important thing to understand here is that the more massive the object, the smaller the wavelength.

Showing that the Electron is a "Particle Wave" 
-----------------------------------------------

If you send a beam of electron through a small single slit, you will get a diffraction pattern that closely resembles what you get when you shine a laser through a small hole.

What is important there is that the hole is roughly the same size as the wavelength of the laser beam or the electron beam. These dark and bright fringes are the same kind of interference that we use to prove that light was a wave!

This figure is not showing light! This is showing electrons! By sending a beam of electron through a small hole and looking where they land, we detect an interference pattern of bright and dark spots typical of waves!")

### Contrast between an electron and the photon. 

**1. Electrons**

The electron is a particle with mass, energy and momentum. There is a wave associated with the electron. We have no name for it, so we call the "wavefunction of the electrons". The amplitude squared of that wave tells us the probability of finding the electrons in a region of space.

The relation between the wave and the particle is the de Broglie relation which tell us that the wavelenght of the wave \(\lambda\) is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle.

\(\lambda = h/p\)

with _h_ being Planck's constant. Because we do not know what is the speed of the wavefunction of the electrons, we cannot use the standard \(v=\lambda f\) to find the frequency of the wave.

**2. Photons**

The photon is a particle with no mass but it still has energy and momentum related by \(E=pc\). There is a wave associated with the photon. We know what that wave is. It is the electromagnetic wave. The amplitude squared of the E&M wave<span> tells us the probability of finding the photons in a region of space. </span>

<span>The relation between the wave and the particle is either de Broglie relation which tell us that the wavelenght of the wave \(\lambda\) is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle. </span>

<span>\(\lambda = h/p\)</span>

with _h_ being Planck's constant. Or we can also use Einstein's relation

\( E= hf\).

These two are equivalent because we know that the E&M wave travels at the speed of light so we know that \(c=\lambda f\) while we also know from special relativity that the energy of the photon is \(E=pc\).

We distinguish four different states of matter and the distinction is all about bounds or links between atoms. Matters around you take many different forms depending on how atoms are combined. Which form of matter you will have under which conditions ultimately depends on the electrical potential energy (chemical bonds between atoms) and the kinetic energy of the atoms.

The four states are

1. **Solid**: Atoms stuck in place.
2. **Liquid**: Atoms still stuck to each other but allowed to move and slip around each other.
3. **Gas**: Atoms are completely free to move around.
4. **Plasma**: Some electrons are freed from the atoms to move independently.

The study of these various states of matter, most particularly the first one, the solid state, is the biggest area of research in physics. The long range order that one can see in solids leads to some extremely interesting phenomena. We will discuss some of these phenomena later on but this is a vast field of research and we will only scratch the surface. Some of the subfields of physics that study states of matter are known as condensed matter physics, atomic and molecular physics, polymer physics, nano-science, etc...

We can form atomic bonds between atoms to form a solid. There are two types of solids, _crystal_ (like metals and salts) which have an orderly pattern, and _amorphous_ solids (like plastic and glass) which have no such patterns.

<div class="question">Q. In the two pictures below which one do you think is a glass? (Click on the image you think is a piece of glass).

1. ![disordered structure (glass)](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W2energy/500px-Silica.svg_.png "glass")**Correct!** In this case, the atoms are all linked together but in a disorganized way with no obvious patterns. This is typical of solid glass. If you break glass, it will break into many pieces with seemingly random shapes and random sizes. On the contrary, if you break a crystal (like diamond), you will often get a clean break with very smooth surfaces because of the order in the atomic structure.
2. ![ordered structure](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W2energy/500px-SiO%C2%B2_Quartz.svg_.png)**No!** There is too much order for this to be a glass, this solid has a crystalline structure.

</div><div class="small-6 medium-4 column right">[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=432|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]</div>In a solid, the atoms or molecules do not move very much but they can still vibrate and rotate. **If the atoms can move and slip past each other we then have a liquid**. In a liquid the atoms are still close to one another but they can move. They share atomic bonds with their neighbors but there is no long-range structure or order. Finally, if the atoms and molecules are not bound (chemically/electrically) at all and just move freely, we have a gas. The atoms/molecules just fly around and once in a while bounce into each other.  
  
The final state of matter is the plasma. This is like a gas but where the atoms/molecules have been ionized and so we have free electrons moving around unattached. The sun is not a big ball of gas. It is a big plasma ball. The atmosphere is not all gases, in the upper reaches, it is a plasma. Finally in your plasma TV, well you have a plasma. So this state of matter while less known is nevertheless pretty important!

### Demo Molecular Balls.

In the demo below, Prof. Leblond works with a model that illustrates atoms in a gas.

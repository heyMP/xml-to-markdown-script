To understand how photons behave, we need to take a pause and talk about probability.

Imagine the following situation: You are blindfolded and throwing darts at a dartboard as shown in the image below. You roughly know where the dartboard is and most of your shots are near the center. After a 100 shots, you get this:

![throwing darts blindfolded at a board. 45 fall in region A (center), 35 in region B (middle ring) and 20 in region C all th rest.](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/dartboardthrows.png "Random throws of dart on a dartboard. ")

<span style="line-height: 20.4px;">First, a quick question</span>

<div class="question">Q. Given the results of the 100 previous shots, can you predict where the next one (101) will be?

1. [Yes, in region A.](#)**No.** How do you know?
2. [Yes, in region B.](#)**No.** How do you know?
3. [Yes, in region C.](#)**No.** How do you know?
4. [No, I cannot predict.](#)**Correct!** Indeed, it is unpredictable exactly where the next shot will be although we can determine the probability for each regions.

</div>Defining Probability
--------------------

Because 45 out of 100 throws ended up in region A, we could say that the chance of hitting region A is 45%. In general we can say that the probability of hitting region A is just the number of hits in A divided by the total.

\(P_A = \frac{N_A}{N_{tot}}\)

This is more and more accurate as the total number of throws gets really large. Similarly, we can define the probability of throwing in region B and C (\(P_B\) and \(P_C\)) by counting the number of throws in region B or C (\(N_B\) or \(N_C\)) and dividing it by the total number of throws (\(N_{TOT}\)). The bigger the total number of throws, the more accurate the probability becomes.

The Word OR
-----------

Let's say you want to know the probability that the dart was in region A **OR** region B. What do you do?

Since it does not matter which one, you just count all throws in A or B.

\(P_{A\; or \; B} = \frac{N_A + N_B}{N_{tot}} = P_A+P_B\)

So, the probability of hitting A or B is the sum of the probability of hitting A and probability of hitting B. So in our example this would be 35% + 45% = 80%.

Note that the chance of hitting anything at all (A OR B OR C) should be 1 or 100%.

\(P_A+P_B+P_C =1\)

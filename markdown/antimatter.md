A consequence of both relativity (week 5) and quantum mechanics (week 10) is that every particle has an antiparticle with the exact same mass but opposite electric charge. We will not explain here why this is true, but suffice to say that by now it is a well-known fact as we have produced many antimatter particles over the years.

The antipartner of the electron is called the positron. It has exactly the same mass but its electric charge is positive.

The proton also has an antiparticle called the antiproton. Again the antiproton has the opposite charge as the proton (so antiproton is negative).

Some particles like the photon are their own antiparticle (in other words there is really no antiphoton). Essentially, this is because it is a neutral particle. The opposite of zero is still zero.

Things to remember about antiparticles:

1. They annihilate when they meet. An electron and a positron that meet will annihilate and transform all their energy into other particles, usually just photons (see Fig 1).
2. The world is made entirely of matter. It is still a big mystery why this is so but all the world we see is made of matter. If we want anti-matter we need to artificially create it. And antimatter doesn't usually last very long. Not because it is unstable but rather because it easily collides with a matter particle to annihilate into.

- Forms of energy are: gravitational potential, kinetic, nuclear, electrical potential, etc…
- Get a good feeling of both tables on daily life section.
- Power is energy delivered per unit of time. Units for power are Watts while Energy would be in Watt-hour for example
- Kinetic energy (denoted K) is given by

\(K = \frac12 mv^2\)

<div class="small-6 medium-4 large-3 column right">[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=444|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image] </div>where if we use kg for mass and meters per second for speed we get K in Joules.

- Conservation of Energy: The total energy in a closed system doesn’t change, but the energy can change forms and move within the system. Look at the pie charts and energy bars in the skater applet. We will use those in assignments.

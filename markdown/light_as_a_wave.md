E & B Field
-----------

You will remember that electric charges are producing electric fields everywhere in space, and these electric fields are what cause the electric force of repulsion and attraction between charges. We also saw that if the electric field (E) is changing (for example, if an electron is moving in a current), it creates a magnetic field B.

The Electromagnetic Wave
------------------------

As you might have guessed already, this back and forth—E creates B which then creates E—can go on indefinitely in the form of a traveling wave as shown below. A changing E field induces a changing B field. This back and forth is a wave and as turns out it is what light is!

Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light with the usual relation

\(c = \lambda f\)

where c stands for the speed of light.

Amplitude, Power and Intensity
------------------------------

Just like any other wave, the electromagnetic wave has, in addition to a wavelength and frequency, an amplitude (A). The bigger the amplitude, the more energy and momentum it carries.

Instead of talking about the amplitude, we often talk about the intensity of a wave I. This is the average energy transferred over a certain area. This is averaged over one cycle of oscillation. The intensity can be written as the power (energy per time) divided by the area

\( I = \frac {\rm{Power}}{\rm{Area}} \)

if you double the amplitude of a wave, the amount of energy per second per unit of area will quadruple.

\(Intensity \propto Amplitude^2\)

The unit of intensity is Watts per meter squared \(W/m^2\)

<div class="question">Q. Let's say you put your hand under a heat lamp. If you double the **amplitude** of the light wave coming out of the heat lamp, how much more intense will it be?

1. [Intensity will double](#)**No.** Try again.
2. [Intensity will quadruple](#)**Correct.** The intensity is quadratic in the amplitude. So doubling the amplitude quadruples the intensity.
3. [Intensity will be reduced by half](#)**No.** Try again.
4. [Can't say](#)**No.** Try again.

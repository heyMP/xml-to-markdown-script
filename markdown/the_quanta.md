Einstein's Explanation. 
------------------------

Einstein's miraculous year of 1905 was truly miraculous. It is often referred to as the [Annus Mirabilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers). He was 26 years old and in that year he published the following 4 papers:

1. **Photoelectric Effect**: "_On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light_" [Original](http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf) and [translated](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_a_Heuristic_Point_of_View_about_the_Creation_and_Conversion_of_Light): This is this week's subject of study. This is the work for which Einstein won the Nobel Prize.
2. **Brownian Motion**: _"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat._" [Original](http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_549-560.pdf) and [translated](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins_brownian.pdf): This paper on Brownian motion was the final proof for atoms (revisit week 1) and started the field of physics known as statistical mechanics.
3. **Special Relativity**: "_On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,_" [Original](http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Zur_Elektrodynamik_bewegter_K%C3%B6rper) and [translated](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/): In this paper, Einstein extended the principle of relativity to include electrodynamics and showed that the speed of light was constant in all reference frames (revisit week 5).
4. **Energy Mass Equivalence**: "_Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?_" [Original](http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_18_639-641.pdf) and [translated](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/www/): This was a direct consequence of the previous paper. He showed, among other things, that \(E = mc^2\) (revisit week 5).

- A: Yes, this is unparalleled. There have been many important discoveries in physics, but to have so many, in widely different subjects, in a single year is truly remarkable.
- S: So what was Einstein's solution?

Einstein's proposition is that light is not really a continuous wave but, instead, arrives in small packets, small bunches. He imagined that each quantum of light has an energy given by

\(E = hf \)

where f is the frequency and h is Planck's constant. (It was introduced by Max Planck a couple years earlier.) Planck's constant is very important in this course. It is as important as it is small

\(h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\;J\cdot s = 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\cdot s\)

where we can write the units as Joules times second or electron volt (1 eV = \(1.602\times10^{-19}\) J) times second. Einstein then supposed that when light interacts with electrons, it is an all-or-nothing business. The electrons can absorb only 1 quanta of light (not 1.5 not 2).

Einstein's equation \(E = hf \) is super simple and important. I do expect you to be able to use it, so let's practice.

Let's see how this could work. Imagine that the electrons in a metal like zinc are in a potential well (like a pool) that is 3 eV (3 electron volts) in depth.

<div class="question">Q. Let's say we shine a UV light with frequency \(8.02 \times 10^{14}\) Hz. What happens?

1. [The electron absorbs one photon and escapes the well.](#)**Correct!** This is a very simple equation but you need to get out your calculator. The energy of a UV photon with this frequency is \(E= 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\;s \times 8.02 \times 10^{14}\; 1/s = 3.32 \) eV which is enough to escape the box (with 0.32 eV of kinetic energy left to spare and make it to the anode).
2. [The electron absorbs multiple photons and escapes the well.](#)**No.** Each interaction is one photon at a time.
3. [The electron absorbs one photon but remains in the well.](#)**No.** The photon has enough energy
4. [None of the above.](#)**No.**

</div><div class="question">Q. Lets say a shine yellow light with frequency \(5.19 \times 10^{14}\) Hz. What happens?

1. [The electron absorbs one photon and escapes the well.](#)**No.** Not enough energy.
2. [The electron absorbs multiple photons and escapes the well.](#)**No.** Each interaction is one photon at a time.
3. [The electron absorbs one photon but remains in the well.](#)**Correct!** Again, you need to get out your calculator: The energy of a yellow photon with this frequency is \(E= 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\;s \times 5.19 \times 10^{14}\; 1/s = 2.14\) eV which is _not enough_ to escape the box.
4. [None of the above.](#)**No.**

<div class="question">Q In the article you just read, which atoms did the scientists move?

1. [nickel](#)**No.** The crystal of Nickel is the solid on which the IBM name stand.
2. [IBM](#)**No.** IBM is a company, not an atom.
3. [xenon](#)**Yes!** Xenon is an atom in the noble gas family. This is indeed the type of atom they moved.
4. [electron](#)**No.** Electrons are inside every atoms.
 
</div><div class="question">Q What kind of device did they use to move them?

1. [a fork](#)**No.** That would be hard.
2. [laser](#)**No.** That would be hard.
3. [scanning tunneling microscope](#)**Correct!** Indeed! We will encounter this type of microscope when we start learning quantum mechanics. Here the IBM scientist did not use the device as a microscope, instead they realize they could use the tip of the needle to move one atom at a time!
4. [Electromagnetic fields](#)**No.** That would be hard.

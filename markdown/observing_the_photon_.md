So light has a pretty strange behavior.

It moves like a wave, but the wave only tells us where we will most probably find the photons. Every time we go and interact with the wave, we detect individual photons. So light interacts as a particle but moves like a wave.

It is often tempting to think that light is both a wave and a particle at the same time. **This is wrong!** The video belows show a great example of a system of a particle attached to a wave. These are bouncing oil droplets that bounces because the whole box the liquid is in is shaking back and forth. The bouncing produces a wave on the liquid which then interact with the droplet and can guide it.

In fact, you can send these bouncing droplets through a double slits experiments. Because of the wave guiding them, we do detect an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes. There are places where no oil droplet go (dark fringes).

This is partially illustrated [in this video](https://youtu.be/fnUBaBdl0Aw?t=3m15s) of oil droplets going through a double slit (but be careful since the beginning contains misinformation and this is not how quantum mechanics works!). I am showing you this video so that you stop thinking that light is a normal wave and it is a normal particle at the same time. It is a new object that **we _call the wave/particle duality_.**

We can tell that the wave/particle is different from the oil droplet + wave above with a simple experiment. If you look at the oil droplet + wave going through the double slits in the video, you can clearly see which slit the droplet went through. What if we do the same with the photons? What if we had a way of determining which slit the photons went through?

We can do that experiment. We can look to determine which slit the photon is going through but when you do look you interact with light which means it will suddenly be a particle. And so when you look, it is not a wave going through the double slits but a particle with a well defined location which means the interference pattern disappears.

<span>This is to be contrasted to the oil droplet + wave. So the wave/particle is a different kind of object! </span>

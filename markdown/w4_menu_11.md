- S: Isn't this a little bit of a tricky definition? How do we know whether something is truly fundamentally inertial?
- M: We don't, really, and the theory of general relativity of Einstein improves on this situation; but, for the moment, just think of any reference moving at constant velocity as being inertial. Let's look at an example.

- What happens if something has no mass like light?
- S: Well let's see , \(m=0\) so that means that \( E =pc\).
- M: Yes and this equation is just as important as the first one. This is the energy of massless particles like light!
- S: But I though that the momentum was \(p=\gamma mv\).
- M: True but for light we have that 1) \( m=0\) and 2) the speed is c which means \(\gamma \rightarrow \infty\). So this is a very large number times a very small number and that formula does not give you any useful answer.
- M: For light, it turns out that the momentum p is just E/c.
- S: Wow, ok this is all a bit mind blowing.
- M: Well you can go back over it since, just like that, we are done with the building blocks of nature. That was it. Next week, we will look at the life of the electron.

Add velocities in different reference frame with the low speed formula and the high speed relativistic formula.

- M: This relative velocity business is simple but can be confusing. Try the exercise below, Sophie.

<div class="question">Q. A boat is passing by you as you stand on the ground. There is a person walking along the boat. Rank these four situations according to the **personâ€™s velocity relative to the boat from greatest to least velocity** (negative number is less than zero and smaller). Blue arrows are \(v_{PG}\), the velocity of person with respect to ground. Black arrows are \( v_{BG}\), the velocity of the boat with respect to the ground. We want to rank \(v_{PB}\), velocity of person with respect to boat.

1. [IV > I > II = III](#)**No.** But you got the first one right.
2. [IV > II > I = III](#)**Correct!** This is a difficult question so don't worry if you did not get it on the first try. The first step is to write the formula for \(v_{PB}\) which is \(v_{PB} = v_{PG} + v_{GB}\). You can guess it by just looking at arrows. The black arrow is \(v_{BG}\) which is \(-v_{GB}\). So \(v_{PB}\) is just blue minus black.  
    
   i. -2-3 = -5 m/s,  
   ii. -3-(-2) = -1 m/s  
   iii. -3-2 = - 5 m/s  
   iv. 2 -(-3) = 5 m/s  
    
   so biggest to smallest is IV> II> I=III. (negative numbers are smaller than positive numbers).
3. [I > III > II > IV](#)**No.**
4. [I = III > II > IV](#)**No.**
5. [I = II = III = IV](#)**No.**
 
</div>Try this exercise with the addition formula.

<div class="question">Q. In the figure with the two trains (repeated here). What is the speed of train 2 with respect to train 1 \(v_{21}\)? From the figure you can read that \(v_{1G} = 0.8 c\) and \(v_{2G} = -0.8 c\). The minus sign is because the train is moving left.

![two trains in head on collision at 0.8 c. In the first case, speeds are measured with respect to the ground while in the second they are measured with respect to train 1. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W4spacetime/twotrains.png)

1. [\(v_{21} = 0.8c\)](#)**No.**
2. [\(v_{21} = 0.98c\)](#)**No.**
3. [\(v_{21} = -0.8c\)](#)**No.**
4. [\(v_{21} = -0.98c\)](#)**Correct!** \(v_{21} =\frac{v_{2G}+v_{G1}}{1+\frac{v_{2G}v_{G1}}{c^2}}\) with \(v_{2G} = -0.8c\) and \(v_{G1} = -0.8c\) gives \(v_{21} = -0.98c\).
 
</div>We will see about gravity much later on but lets say you want to measure \(g\). You have your own theory of gravity which predicts a value for \(g\) and so as a scientist you want to compare you theory with the world. The formula for the period from your theory is

\(T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\)

**Inertial reference frame**: This is a reference frame (where an observation is made), which is moving at a constant velocity with respect to all other inertial reference frames.

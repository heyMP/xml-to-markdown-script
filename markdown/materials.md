Required Textbook
-----------------

The textbook for this class is _Physics and Technology for Future Presidents: An Introduction to the Essential Physics Every World Leader Needs to Know_ by Richard Muller. (Make sure not to buy the pop-science book called “Physics for Future Presidents” by the same author.) There will be some extra reading material that will be posted on Angel and on the library’s E-reserves.

You can find it on Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Technology-Future-Presidents-Introduction/dp/0691135045/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1376505727&sr=8-1&keywords=physics+and+technology+for+future+presidents).

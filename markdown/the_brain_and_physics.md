### The Brain

Some people believe that intellectual ability is purely genetic or fixed.

This is a myth. Research now shows that your brain is like a muscle; the more you apply it and struggle, the more it grows. People who learn to recognize this fact about their own brain develop a ‘growth mindset’ and are able to persevere and achieve more.

### Physics

Physics is the science that tries to understand how the natural world works. We are particularly interested in the study of energy and matter. People are often scared about physics because of the math and all the formulas. Well be assured

Physics is not about memorizing formulas  
 (though we will memorize a few)  
 Physics is not about “plug-and-chug”

Physics is about changing how you think about the world around you.

This course is about reasoning about physics - what are the big ideas (there is only a few), where we see them at work, and how they affect our world!

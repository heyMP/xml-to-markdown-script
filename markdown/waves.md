We are nearing the end of the basic building blocks of nature! Only two more blocks to go, **waves** and then the **space-time continuum**. Let's remember what we have seen up to now. The world is made of atoms which are themselves made of electrons and a nucleus which is made of protons and neutrons. These particles have energy which can take many forms. Energy is the ability to do work.

So where do waves fit in this picture?

- M: Hey, Sophie, back again!
- S: Yes, although a bit scared about the last two building blocks. Waves and spacetime sounds like its going to be complicated.
- M: Ah don’t worry. Waves are not that tricky and you deal with them all the time in your daily life. There are many different type of waves: sound, waves in water, pulse on a string, light, and many more.
- S It is hard to see what those things have in common.
- M: Well that's what we do in physics—find out what is common to all things!
- M: The basic definition of a wave is “It's a disturbance from equilibrium that propagates with time from one region of space to another."
- M: In the slow motion movie below we see water which is made of a very large number of atoms. When a droplet falls on the surface it creates a disturbance which propagates away from where the droplet fell. That's the wave. If you have a single droplet falling, we get a single non-repeating disturbance. We call that a pulse. If your faucet was leaking a droplet every second, we would get a periodic repeating wave in the water.

Oscillations vs Waves 
----------------------

- Oscillations: Something that oscillates back and forth 
  - Described by a period (T), a frequency (f) and an amplitude (A).
- Wave: A type of oscillation (disturbance) that travels in space. 
  - Described by a period (T), a frequency (f) and an amplitude (A) like an oscillation
  - But also has a wavelength \(\lambda\) which is the distance between wave crests.

A wave varies in space with wavelength \(\lambda\). A plot of a wave variation in space looks like

<div class="figurelabel"><div class="figurelabel__title">Fig 6</div><div class="figurelabel__desc">This is a wave oscillating up and down in the y direction but traveling in the x direction.</div> </div> ![graph of y versus x for a wave showing the wavelength](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W3waves/wavegraph.png "Fig 6 : This is a wave oscillating up and down in the y direction but traveling in the x direction.")The wavelength is the distance between peaks. **Note that position, x, not the time, is on the horizontal axis.** This is important not to confuse this figure (fig 6) with the oscillation graph (fig 5 on previous page).

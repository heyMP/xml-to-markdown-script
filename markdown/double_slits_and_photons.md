The 2-Slit Experiment
---------------------

- B: Sophie, can you see the nice double slit interference pattern in the Fig. 10?
- S: Yes, I have seen it a couple of times. This is what light looks like on a screen after you go through two small holes.
- B: Ok, cool. However, that is not really what I see. Alice and I detect individual photons. Therefore, we see the Fig. 11. The photons arrive one by one and eventually the whole bunch of photons starts looking like the interference pattern on the left.
- S: Very strangeâ€¦
- A: It looks like the dartboard in the probabiliity interlude, doesn't it? It is actually impossible to predict exactly where the next photon will land, but we can use what we did with the dartboard and define probabilities.

Let's say we want to know the probability that a photon will land on the screen in some small band of width \(\delta x\) near position _x_ (see Fig. 12). Just as we did for the dartboard, we look where the photons land. After sending a lot of photons, we can define the probability of landing in the rectangle of Fig. 12 by counting how many photons landed there versus the total that we sent.

![a strip of width delta x at x. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/2slitsProbability.png "Fig 12: Photons arrive randomly on the screen. To find the probability for them to land in a small rectangle, we just count how many there are in the rectangle and divide by the total. ")

And here is the main idea

As you can see with your eyes, there are more photons where the light wave is more intense. So it looks like, **given the intensity of the electromagnetic wave, we can predict the probability of where the photons will go!**

This is easy and that's all there is to it. We cannot predict where exactly the photon will go, but we can predict its most probable endpoint.

So there is a **link between the wave and the particle**. And the link is that:

> **The probability Prob(x) of detecting a photon at a particular point x is directly proportional to the intensity of the light wave at that point.**
> 
> \(\rm{Prob}(x) \propto I(x) \propto A(x)^2\)
> 
> In the last part, we wrote that the intensity is the square of the amplitude of the wave A. For an electromagnetic wave, the amplitude will be given by the maximum electric field as we saw before.

- Try this simulation from PHET. After turning on the source and adding a double slit, you can change the display to show "hits." This way you can see the individual photons hitting the screen. Check out the single particles tab as well!

The learning material for this course is provided on the course content site under the Lessons section on the left sidebar.

Labs
----

There will be three lab reports to be submitted based on virtual labs and simulations. These lab reports will be completed in Angel. You will need to enable JAVA to run the simulation. For security reason we recommend to disable JAVA in your browser after each use.

Project: News Article
---------------------

You will be expected to complete one project related to class material. This will be in the form of a news article for the "Nerdy Geek Magazine". This article will need to be on a scientific subject of your choice that is related to the concepts discussed in this class. There will be two components. In the first part, you will do research on your project and produce “index cards” (to be turned in) that can then be used to write the news article. Then you will individually write a scientific news article on the subject. More detailed information will be given in time.

Homework
--------

Homework will be submitted on Angel and they aim to test your understanding of the material and to work on practice questions similar to what you will find in the midterms and final. Doing the homework and making sure to go back to understand the questions you missed is one of the best way to do well in class!

Discussion Boards
-----------------

There will be weekly graded discussion boards. Each discussion board will have specific instructions and grading scheme.

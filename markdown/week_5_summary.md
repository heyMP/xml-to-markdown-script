- ![USSR stamp of Einstein](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W4spacetime/Albert_Einstein_1979_USSR_Stamp.jpg)You should know some basic facts about the neutrino and about the Opera experiments.
- Special relativity is like good old relativity but extended to all laws of physics not just mechanics.
- From that principle and the theory of electricity, it follows that the speed of light is always the same for any moving observers.
- Einstein worked consequences of this fact and they are very strange (but true!)
  - Time dilation: Time runs more slowly when you go fast (in order to measure the same speed of light)
  - Mass and energy are one and the same.
- The formula for energy is \(E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2\). If you have no momentum (i.e., if you are not moving and \(p=0\)) then this is just the famous formula \(E = mc^2\).

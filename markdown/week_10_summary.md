- the color pattern of a thin film is due to interference of light which is typical wave behavior.
- the fringe pattern in the double slits experiment is also due to interference (a wave behavior).
- the photo-electric experiment shows that light can be viewed as being made of particles.
- To reconcile these experiments, it must be that the light moves like a wave but interacts like a particle.
- The links between the wave and the particle description are as follows
  - â€‹w<span style="line-height: 20.4px;">here the wave is more intense, you have more chances to find the particles. If the intensity is zero, you will not find any particles (so electrons have dark and bright fringes just like light!)</span>
  - the frequency _f_ of the wave determines the energy _E_ of the corresponding particles via \(E = hf\) .

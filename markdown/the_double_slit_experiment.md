Single Slit
-----------

Wave interference is one of the most important property of waves and it is the fundamental difference between waves and particles. Just as a single earthquake wave can interact with itself and cancel at some places, other waves can also do that.

For example, let's just look at light going through a single hole (single slit).

The wave has some size and it must wiggle through the hole. It then expands afterwards, it interacts with itself, and in some places it cancels, while in others it doubles. We get a series of ringâ€“like features (Fig. 5). This interference pattern is visible and more pronounced when the size of the hole is roughly the same length as the wavelength of the light that shines on it.

Double Slit
-----------

The double slit experiment shows an even simpler interference pattern. This experiment is also quite famous for other reasons and we will return to it in later parts of the class. The set-up is simple (see Fig. 6). We shine light on a screen with two holes (two slits) of a certain size and a certain distance apart. If the holes are very small compared to the wavelength of the incident light, then it is just as if we had two point sources separated by a small distance. So this is a very clean set-up and we can easily predict the interference pattern. It looks like a long line of equally spaced dark and bright spots.

See the image below (Fig. 7) for the real life end result.

- S: Pretty cool images. So physicists can calculate all of that?
- M: Yes, and it's actually not very hard. The interference pattern is completely predicted. We can figure out the position of each bright and dark spots by just knowing the size and shape of the slits, the distance between them, and the wavelength of the incident wave.
- S: Ok, that's pretty neat.
- M: You will play a bit with that in your lab this week. Oh, and by the way, this interference phenomena would occur for any waves, not just light.
- S: Really? So if I shouted through a wall with two holes in it, somebody on the other side would hear nothing in some spots and loud sound in others?
- M: Exactly! You must have the right size of holes compared to the wavelength of the sound you emit, but, yes, you can do interference with sound, light, earthquake, etc... any waves.

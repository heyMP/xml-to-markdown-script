In the ancient world it was observed that when rubbed, amber would give off sparks and attract (small) items.

We now understand that for some material it is possible to take away electrons or add more electrons simply by rubbing. We don't have a good understanding of this but for some material, the electrons on the surface can be easily taken away while other material can easily steal electrons when you rub them.

This excess or lack of electrons in a material leads to static electricity. The electric force is a powerful force, much stronger than gravity; even a small excess or lack of electrons can create huge effects.

By doing experiments we determined the following properties of the electric force

1. Like charges repulse while opposite charges attract.
2. The electric force acts over long distance but gets weaker the farther we go.
3. The electric force can easily be more important than gravity and lift objects.

In the video below, you can see static electricity in real life. The person reacts very calmly (and correctly) when sparks from static electricity light the gas on fire!

\*\* note that she was touching her shirt. Some electrons got rub off on her hand (either less or more electrons, we can't tell). A spark then occur just when she touches the nozzle. This is very rare but do be careful! if you have a lot of static electricity touch your hand on the car to discharge.

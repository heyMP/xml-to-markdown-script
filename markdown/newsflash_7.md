Solar cell technology is a field of very active research nowadays. If we average over the full surface of the planet, we find that the sun gives us about 164 Watts of power per square meter.

There is a lot of energy to be gathered from the sun!

From reading the article, can you answer the following few questions?

<div class="question">Q. Solar cells produce electricity from sunlight using which of the following?

1. [Band effect.](#)**No.**
2. [Meisner effect.](#)**No.**
3. [Doppler effect.](#)**No.**
4. [Photovoltaic effect.](#)**Correct!** Indeed the crucial physics behind solar cells is the photovoltaic effect, which is about photons (light) interacting with electrons to create a current.
 
</div><div class="question">Q. The article discusses new technological advances for polymer based solar cells technology. What are the advantage(s) of such technology compared to silicon-based device?

As we look at those billions of galaxies, there is one thing that is pretty striking, every single one of them is moving away from us! We must smell very bad.

- S: strange, but how do we know at what speed they are moving?
- M: yes, this is the right question. It is a combination of two things.

Spectral Lines and the Doppler effect.
--------------------------------------

As we saw in week 12, energy of electrons inside of atoms are quantized. If you shine white light (with all colors) on a gas of a certain kind of atoms, only very specific set of wavelengths are absorbed. Theses lines of absorptions are unique to each atom and by looking at those lines we can tell the atomic composition of galaxies and stars (see Fig. 13).

There is even more information in those lines that we can extract when we know about the Doppler effect.

Doppler Effect.
---------------

You know what the Doppler effect is from the sound of sirens on ambulances (or the whistle of a moving train). The Doppler effect arises when a source of a wave is moving. As you can see in Fig. 14, as the source moves to the right, the wavelength of the wave on the right is smaller than the wavelength on the left.

The wave is stretched if the source is moving away from you or it becomes more squeezed if the source is moving towards you; i.e., without looking you can tell whether the train is coming toward you or going away from you.

This is why the siren of an ambulance suddenly changes its pitch as it passes near you.")

Redshift
--------

If a source of light moves toward you, the wavelength will be shortened which means it will be bluer. If it moves away, the wavelength gets bigger and it becomes redder. What we see when we look at the Universe is that every galaxy (except for a couple of very close-by galaxies), are moving away from us. When we look at the pattern of light for the hydrogen atom for example, the whole pattern is just as we expect to be but it is shifted to the red (see Fig. 15).

The modern interpretation of these observations is that the Universe is expanding. The spacetime tapestry is expanding such that the length of a meter is getting bigger with time. This expansion is happening everywhere and every galaxy is moving away from us and away from each other.

Now let us look a well known properties of light that is easy to explain if light is a wave but much more puzzling if light is a particle.

<span style="line-height: 20.4px;">When you shine light on a surface, it sometimes comes back at you. Why?</span>

- S: I guess light does not like some surfaces?
- M: On the contrary, they really like each other. . .
- S: Why do you say that?
- M: Well, when light is reflected, what is happening is you just shone light into a material where the electron was free to move and the electron then absorbed the light.
- S: Absorbed it? It's reflected!
- M: Let me finish. . . absorbed it, then the electron moved and it reemitted the light. This is what reflection really is. The waves arrive, the electrons feel a varying E field, they move and they shake, reemitting the light toward the source.
- S: Hmm. . . pretty cool. Electrons really do move a lot. :)

How much of the wave gets reflected versus how much gets transmitted is dependent on the material. Essentially, if the electrons in the material are able to move enough to reflect the whole wave, they will. If not, only a partial reflection will be seen. Fig 1 show a total reflection from Lake Mirror in Oregon while Fig 2 and 3 shows a partial reflection from the glass.

Oil Slick
---------

Now imagine the following situation. You shine light on a thin, partially reflecting surface, like an oil slick. Part of the incident light will be reflected while part of it will be transmitted. The transmitted wave will reach the second surface and be reflected and finally interfere with the first reflected light.

The second reflection has traveled an extra distance compared to the first one as seen in Fig. 4.

<div class="question">Q. Imagine that you shine a blue light ray almost straight down (with wavelength \(\lambda = 480\) nm) on a thin film of size of 1 \(\mu\)m. Do you expect constructive or destructive interference?

1. [Constructive.](#)**Correct!** 1 micrometer is 1000 nm which is about twice the wavelength of blue light. So the light ray will interfere constructively.
2. [Destructive.](#)**No.** Think again.
3. [Cannot answer.](#)**No.** Think again.

</div>- M: Thin films can produce some nice visuals, as you can see in Fig. 5 below, which shows a soap bubble. Do you think you can explain that, Sophie?
- S: Let's see. Different colors of light are just different wavelengths. For a given thin film thickness, some color will interfere constructively, and these are the colors that we will see the most.
- M: Very good. So why is the color different on different parts of the bubble?
- S: Is the incident light different?
- M: No, we shine "white" light, which contains all colors.
- S: Oh, I know! The thickness varies!
- M: Exactly. The thickness of the soap bubble is not the same everywhere. Small changes in thickness lead to this beautiful pattern of light!

### Constructive versus Destructive

Below, in Figs. 6 and 7, you can see the difference between a constructive and destructive interference. The thickness of the film is what determines whether a color will be enhanced or decreased. Review week 4 which discusses the important concept of wave interference.

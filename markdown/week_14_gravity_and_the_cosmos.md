Lesson Objectives
-----------------

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

1. Identify the important scaling relationships in Newton's law of gravity.
2. Note some differences between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory of General Relativity.
3. Identify and name different orbits (like low-earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit) and how they depend on masses of each objects.
4. Use the right scaling relationship for orbital velocity as a function of distance.
5. Explain how the Doppler effect is used to detect redshift of galaxies and the expansion of the Universe.

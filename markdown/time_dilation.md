How can this work in practice?  
  
Look at the two images below (Fig. 5 and 6).

**\*\*The symbol \(\Delta\) in \(\Delta t\) just denote an interval of time. In general \(\Delta \) means difference between the final value of something and its initial value.**

On the left, I am sending a pulse of light up to a mirror and it bounces back. The time it took for the trip back and forth is just the distance divided by the speed

\(time = \frac{distance}{speed}\)

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=981|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]

On the top (Fig. 5) the observer is at rest and the time measured is

\(\Delta t = 2L/c\)

This is just distance divided by the speed, in this case the speed of light.<span style="font-size: 1rem;">[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=982|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Now another observer passes by and he/she measures the time on his/her clock between the start and the end of the pulse of light. As you can see from the figure on the bottom (Fig 6), the distance travelled as seen by the observer moving is bigger. But the speed is supposed to be the same. Since \(\Delta t' = \frac{distance}{c}\) and the distance is bigger, it must be that the time is longer</span>

\(\Delta t' > \Delta t \)

This is **time dilation**. If I measure the time between two events on my watch, and you measure the time between the same two events but you are moving, your time will be longer than mine.

- S: Ok that's pretty cool. Do you have a real life example? It's hard to grasp.
- M: Not many, the speed has to be very high (with respect to \(c\)) for this effect to be noticeable. If an astronaut moves at 11 km/s around the Earth for one year, then his/her clock will be slow compared to ours by 0.02 s (after one year!). It is really a small effect.
- S: Wow, I see.
- M: But still it is important, since this is how the notion of a speed limit makes sense. The faster you go, the more time delay you get. It also affects the measurement of length it turns out. In the opposite way. Length gets contracted.
- S: All of this because light needs to travel at the same speed for all observers moving at constant velocity.
- M: Yes, measurements in spacetime adjust themselves in such a way that the speed of light is constant. It's a property of the spacetime tapestry we live in. It's a fact of Nature if you want.

**\*\* When you move your clocks slows so that time intervals are shorter when compared with somebody not moving. So if you take a space trip at high speed, people on Earth will age faster than you.**

Here are some of the main points of this week. This is not meant to be exhaustive and you should refer to your textbook and to the webpages before.

Numbers and Units
-----------------

- a nanometer is \(10^{-9}\) m and atoms are about 0.1 nm in size.
- there are \(10^{23}\) atoms in a mole and this is more than the numbers of stars in our galaxy!
- When you multiply two numbers in exponential notation you add the exponents. \(10^{23}\) \(\times\) \(10^{-10}\) gives \(10^{23-10}= 10^{13}\).
- We will use SI units of meters, second and kilogram. The second is defined by a standard atomic clock and the meter is derived from the second by defining the speed of light to be \(c = 299\; 792\; 458\; \frac{m}{s}\). This is a difficult number to remember and we will often just say that the speed of light is c = 300,000,000 m/s or \(c = 3\times 10^8\;m/s\)

Atomic Theory
-------------

- Atoms are small, numerous, ageless and move around constantly.
- Brownian motion refers to the random motion of large particles when atoms constantly hit them.

Structure of Atoms
------------------

- Atoms are made of protons (+ 1 electric charge) and neutrons (0 charge) surrounded by electrons (-1 negative charge).
- Atoms are mostly just made of void or nothing.

Elements
--------

- Each element in the periodic table has an atomic number, which is the number of protons. Change the number of protons and you change the element.

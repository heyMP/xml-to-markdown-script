Lets practice an ethical analysis on the following article

[Opera Neutrino Superluminal Travel](http://news.sciencemag.org/europe/2011/10/faster-light-result-be-scrutinized)

we will apply to the following seven steps to understand the ethics.

1. Identify ethical issues: This is the first step, one should identify the major ethical issues in a news story.
2. Identify relevant facts: Then you need the facts. Almost always, news articles only contain a fraction of all the facts. In order to resolve the ethical situation, one often needs to gather additional facts.
3. Identify Stakeholders: Who are the different parties involved?
4. Identify values: What are the moral values at stakes? Think of values like fairness, integrity, trustworthiness, ...
5. Identify relevant right and duty of the stakeholders.
6. Identify consequences of various actions
7. Use moral imagination to propose resolutions.

But let's forget about the resolution of the experiment (the improperly connected cable) and let's examine the ethical situation before they found out about the cable. Should they announce the strange results? How much verification do they need before claiming such a big discovery?

1. Ethic spot: What are the ethical issues here?

- Was proper care given in the experiment?
- Created a big fuss with the press conference.
- Costly independent experiment will be needed to check result. <span id="cke_bm_76E" style="display: none;"> </span>

1. Facts (Here, I added some facts in addition to what is in the article):

- Opera released to the public a result that \(\nu\) travels faster than light.
- They claim it's a curious result but with extraordinary consequences.
- Big press conference at CERN.
- Opera is an independent experiment from CERN, but it uses the neutrino produced at CERN.
- Large and expensive second (and third) experiments will be needed to reproduce these claims.

1. Stakeholders:

- CERN: Centre Européen de Recherche Nucléaire. This is a really big center of research with more than 5,000 scientists working at the Center and many countries involved. It is situated in Switzerland, near Geneva and the French-Swiss border.
- OPERA: Opera is the name of the experiment. It is mostly a neutrino detector situated in a lab under a mountain (to protect from cosmic rays). The Lab is called Gran Sasso and it's in Italy.
- Public: The general public is a stakeholder in this story. Thru taxes, the public paid for the experiments (both Cern and Opera).
- Other experiments & the scientific community: Other labs may need to create an experiment to reproduce the results. Physicists will struggle to work out the theoretical implications of such a big discovery.

1. Values:

- Trustworthiness.
- Honesty.
- Responsibility.

1. Rights and Duties:

- OPERA: Duty to be careful and, to the best of their ability, identify all systematic errors.
- Public & scientific community: Right to know.

1. Consequences:

- Costly experiments created for nothing if it turns out to be a simple mistake,
- Result is correct --> big triumph of science --> Nobel prize.

1. Moral Imagination. Imagine you are the head of the Opera experiment. The results are in. You think the experiment is sound. The public has the right to know what you discovered (using their money). So what would you do?

Think about it. Even write some ideas down.

<div class="question">Here are some of my ideas of what one could do (in this kind of list you should include even really obviously bad ideas).

1. [My ideas](#)a. Don't reveal results, check and recheck and recheck. Suspend all other labs and check until the end of time.
  
  b. Reveal results but without a press release and without too much fanfare, emphasizing even more the fact that it must be a systematic error.
  
  c. Reveal results, do not return and run further checks on your experiment. Wait for other costly experiments to try to reproduce you results.
 
</div>Any favorites? Any obvious bad choices? There is no wrong answers here. You just analyse a situation and imagine your own moral options.

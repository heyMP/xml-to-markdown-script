- The four fundamental forces of Nature are:

1. Gravity
2. Weak
3. Strong
4. Electromagnetic

- Newton's laws in terms of momentum:

1. **If there is no force acting on particle/wave, the momentum remains the same**.
2. **If a force acts on a particle it changes its momentum**.
3. **Momentum is conserved.**

- **â€‹**A constant force F applied over an interval of time \(\Delta t\) changes the momentum by the amount   
  \( F\Delta t = \Delta p\)

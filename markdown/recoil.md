Recoil is a good example of momentum conservation.

Imagine a cannon, loaded with cannon ball, at rest on the fortification. The initial speed (as seen from somebody also at rest) is zero and therefore the system

Cannon + cannonball

Has zero momentum. After ignition, the cannon ball shoot of mass \(m_b\) shoot with velocity \(v_b\). Since no momentum can be created or destroyed and since nobody touched the cannon to push the ball, it must be that the system cannon + cannon ball still has zero momentum. This means that the cannon must recoil with equal momentum that the ball took.

As you can see from the figure above. We must have that

\(p_b +p_c = 0\).

This is what recoil is.

Note a couple of important things

1. for the two momenta to add to zero, one of them must be negative of the other. They must be in opposite direction
2. While the cannon and the cannon ball must equal magnitude of momenta (same number but different signs), they do not have the same speed! Momenta is mass times speed and because the cannon as a much bigger mass it will have a much lower speed.

The article for this week is[Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/science/earth/what-to-make-of-a-climate-change-plateau.html?ref=greenhousegasemissions&_r=0&pagewanted=print).

The Greenhouse effect is the warming of the atmosphere due to the way the gases in the atmosphere balance the earth’s and the sun’s radiation. In a nutshell, the greenhouse effect has the following three steps:

![Greenhouse Effect has visible light coming in and infrared unable to come out. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/The_green_house_effect.svg_.png)

- Solar radiation enters atmosphere as short waves (high energy).
- Earth absorbs these short waves but reemits long waves (infrared).
- The long waves get absorbed by the greenhouse gases (mostly CO<sub>2</sub> and water) and come back.

The net effect is analogous to a car in the parking lot. The layer of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is like the windshield. It keeps the Earth warm.

<div class="question">Q. The principle greenhouses gases in our atmosphere are

1. [Hydrogen and helium](#)**No.** There is no pure hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere
2. [Oxygen and nitrogen.](#)**No.** Try again
3. [Water vapor and carbon dioxide.](#)**Correct.** These are the two principle ones.
4. [Methane and ammonia.](#)**No.** These are two greenhouse gases but they exists in smaller quantities.
5. [Sulfuric acid vapor and CO<sub>2</sub>.](#)**No.** Try again

</div>- S: Really? Water is a greenhouse gas? So boiling water is polluting?
- M: Yes, I guess it is. . . but the thing with water is that it falls back down. The concentration of water vapor--unlike the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>--does not seem to be increasing non-stop.
- Bob: Hey, Marie, I think actually that the concentration of water is increasing.
- M: Hey, Bob, good to see you! Is Alice coming too?
- B: Yes, she will be joining us soon.
- M: Great. Sophie, let me introduce you to Bob and Alice who are the Quantum Experts. They will help us understand the quantum world, which we will soon start hearing about!
- S: Cool! Nice to meet you!
- M: But also, as Bob was saying, it is true that the water vapor in the atmosphere seems to have increased, but one of the possible reasons is because the Earth has been pretty warm recently, and warmer air can hold more water vapor than cooler air before it crashes down as rain.
- S: Ah, ok, but if there is more water vapor, that would increase the temperature further from the greenhouse effect.
- B: Yep, it sure should. . .

Global Warming
--------------

Global warming is an important issue and the whole Earth climate is a complicated system. Nevertheless, the basic science behind global warming is simple physics—it is just the greenhouse effect.

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily over the last 50 years (see Fig. 13).

![increase in CO2](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/Mauna_Loa_Carbon_Dioxide-en.svg_.png "Fig 13. Increase of concentration of CO2 measured in part per million (ppm) over the last 50 years. ")

Over the same 50 years the average temperature of the Earth has increased by about 1 degree C (as shown in Fig. 14).

![global temperature rise](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/Global_Temperature_Anomaly_1880-2012.svg_.png "Fig 14. Increase in the average temperature of the Earth over the last 50 years. ")

Now, as we said above, the climate is a very complicated system subject to random fluctuations and variations. Just because the two graphs above look alike does not mean that one is the cause of the other.

Nevertheless many scientists have studied the question. The consensus from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is that

> _It is 90% likely that humans are responsible for at least some or possibly most of the observed global warming of the last 50 years._

This is a surprisingly low-key and restrained position. Most people think scientists are alarmist, but they tend to be very careful in stating their positions.

Warming Plateau
---------------

![zoom on the temperature graph over the last ten years](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/warmingplateaux.png)The article that you read referred to a warming plateau. This is the fact that from 2000 to 2010 the rise in temperature slowed down (it now seems to be back up).

Many critics of global warming use this warming plateau to show that the other side is wrong. This is an example _of cherry-picking data_. Cherry picking refers to the act of choosing data that you like and ignoring the data that you don't like. This is an unethical scientific behavior.

It is already a very hard exercise with many years of work and analysis by a whole community of scientists to reach the conclusion that global warming is real.

You may find someone who just looked at one part of a graph (the temperature graph over the last 10-15 years) and then decided that this means that scientists are wrong, but this is not good science.

Scientists that work on global warming know about the warming plateau. They don't cherry pick data; the warming plateau is included in their analysis. After including all the data (including years where temperature was stable or going down), climate scientists have reached the conclusion that global warming is real and that

> _It is 90% likely that humans are responsible for at least some or possibly most of the observed global warming of the last 50 years._

Quick question before leaving. . .

<div class="question">Q. The greenhouse effect currently warms the earth by approximately (this may be a trick question!!):

1. [1 <sup>º</sup>F](#)**No.** Not even close.
2. [2 <sup>º</sup>F](#)**No.** Not even close.
3. [4 <sup>º</sup>F](#)**No.** Not even close.
4. [35 <sup>º</sup>F](#)**Correct.** Without the greenhouse effect the temperature of the Earth would be so cold that the oceans would be frozen and life would never have started as we know it. The problem with global warming is not the fact that we live on a planet surrounding by a "windshield" like a car in a parking lot. That "windshield" of CO<sub>2</sub> is necessary for life. No, the issue is that we are making that windshield thicker and we don't really know if the earth and life can handle more greenhouse effect.

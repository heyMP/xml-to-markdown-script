Let's practice the use of the potential energy graph.

<div class="question">Q. Imagine a particle with 4 joules of **total** energy. Let's say it is starting at x = 1 m and it is traveling to the right, where is its turning point?

1. [1.0 m](#)**No.** What would you turn back at x =1 m? You have more than 3 Joules of energy. You can keep going.
2. [2.0 m](#)**No.** At x=2 m, the potential energy is zero. So all your energy is kinetic and you are moving fast!
3. [5.0 m](#)**No.** What would you turn back at x =5 m? You have more than 3 Joules of energy. You can keep going.
4. [6.0 m](#)**Correct!** You have a total energy of 4 Joules (see image below). The energy is going to be all potential energy at a position of 6 m. Before that position, we must add something to the blue line in order to get 4 J. That something is kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is maximum (=4 Joules) at x= 2 m where the potential energy is zero. Remember we always have that \(E_{tot} = U+K\).

</div>The Photoelectric Effect
------------------------

![basic figure of photoelectric effect. Photons are shined on a metal and electrons are ejected. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/Photoelectric_effect.svg_.png "Fig. 6. The basic idea behind the photoelectric effect is simple. Light shining on a metal can eject electrons")

The energy graph will be immensely useful as we talk about the behavior of electrons and protons in the next three weeks.

 The photoelectric effect on its own is not so mysterious. You should think of a conductor as a container within which the electrons are trapped. A good analogy would be a swimming pool and the electrons are drops of water. If you jump in the swimming pool and start making waves, drops of water will be thrown away. Analogously, when we shine light on a metal, all the electrons inside are excited and some are ejected. This is the simple physics behind the photoelectric effect, and you may ask what the fuss is all about.

The Stopping Potential
----------------------

Photoelectrons are ejected from the target on the cathode with some kinetic energy. The tube is empty of air; therefore, the electrons just fly from the cathode to the anode with some kinetic energy K creating a current. We can stop the current by turning on an electric potential.

![cathode-anode](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/cathodeanode.png "Fig 7: Electrons are ejected from the cathode on the target, and then fly to the anode. We can set up an electric field between the cathode and anode to prevent the electrons from reaching the anode. ")

**_\*\* Watch out for name confusion:_**

1. Electrical potential is V with units of Volt.
2. Electrical potential energy is U with units of Joules.

As you can remember from weeks 7 and 8, a **volt is energy per unit of charge** and so the relation between V and U is just

\(U = q V\)

They are closely related as you can see.

By turning a potential, it is as if we were setting up a slope, as in Figure 8. The electrons come in with some kinetic energy but they will only reach the top if they have enough kinetic energy

![slopped potential ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/stopping%20potential.png "Fig 8: By setting up a electric potential between cathode and anode. The electrons are now facing a upward slope of potential energy. If they don't have enough kinetic energy, the will not make it to the anode. ")

In the experiment, we adjust the potential on the battery just to the point where there is no more current. This happens when kinetic energy is equal to potential energy on top of the slope. We call this critical value of voltage, **the stopping potential.**

\(K = U = e V_{stop}\)

where e is the charge of the electron. The stopping potential is the minimum voltage needed to stop the electrons. It thus corresponds to a potential energy equal to their kinetic energy.

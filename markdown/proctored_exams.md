You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the necessary steps to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity. <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A proctor is a person in your area with whom you arrange to access your exam via a computer. It is your responsibility to find a proctor as soon as the course begins.</span>

1. Contact a person who [meets the qualifications](http://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/your-courses-how-to-guide/taking-exams-and-securing-a-proctor/acceptable-persons-to-serve-as-proctor "securing a proctor who meets the qualifications") and ask him or her to proctor your exam.
2. Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken. Please see instructions for [securing a suitable proctor](http://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/your-courses-how-to-guide/taking-exams-and-securing-a-proctor "securing a suitable proctor"). While many proctors will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible for paying any expenses incurred in retaining a proctor.
3. You must submit your proctor for approval or schedule your exams at a testing center using our [online proctored exam portal](http://www.proctor.outreach.psu.edu/). You will need to enter your proctor's contact information and submit proctor verification documentation. Note: If your proctor has been previously approved by the World Campus during a prior course within two years, you do not need to obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor information on file for two years.
4. If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
5. If you are a graduating senior requesting a final exam, please see [additional information](http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/StudentServices_Graduation.shtml "Additional Information") about early deadlines for course completion and exam scheduling.
6. [Contact Student Services](http://worldcampus.psu.edu/Contact.shtml "Student Services") if you cannot take a scheduled exam.
7. Unless you have received permission to take your exam at an alternative time, your proctor will only allow you to take the exam during dates specified in your course.
8. If the Tuesday-Thursday is inconvenient for you for any reasons or if you feel unwell to take the exam, do not hesitate to communicate with me Dr. Leblond at [lul29@psu.edu](mailto:lul29@psu.edu) to ask for alternate date.

If you have additional questions about securing a proctor, please contact SES (Student Enrollment Services) TEL: 814-865-5403; or by e-mail at [psuwd@psu.edu](mailto:psuwd@psu.edu).

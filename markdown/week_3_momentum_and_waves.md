Lesson Objectives
-----------------

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

1. Contrast the differences between momentum and energy and summarize the principle of conservation of momentum.
2. Interpret graphical representations of oscillatory motions and of waves. Extract from the graphs information about the period (T), frequency f = 1/T [in units of Hertz (Hz) = 1/s], amplitude A and wavelength \(\lambda\).
3. Employ correctly the relation between wavelength, frequency and speed of a wave \((v=\lambda f\)) being careful to keep the velocity constant.
4. Describe the basic features of the sound wave.
5. Enumerate various ways in which the speed of sound can change and explain how variations in the speed of sound lead to bending of waves.

All of this was for the simplest atom, hydrogen. For atoms with more protons, neutrons and electrons, the problem becomes much harder to solve. The main reason for the complication is that the electrons not only interact attractively with the proton, they also repulse each other. As soon as there are more than 1 electron in an atom, this repulsion becomes important.

Nevertheless, the same wavefunctions, the same orbitals, apply to all atoms. The difference is the formula for the energy levels, which is impossible to solve in closed form for all atoms except hydrogen (and its isotope, deuterium). We rely on numerical computations on computers to find the energy levels.

Systems with multiple electrons raise an important question. How many electrons are allowed in a state? Can we just pack up all the electrons in the ground state? If this were true, all atoms would have almost the same size and the same chemical properties. This is not what we see.

</div>- S: Ok you better explain this. What is so different between the photon and the electron? Is it because of the electric charge?
- A: Good try, but no. No, the neutron or the neutrino have zero electric charge and yet they behave like the electron in that only one particle per state is allowed. The explanation we have is not that satisfactory, but here it is.

Fermions and Bosons
-------------------

- A: You remember this spin business we talked about when we introduced the electron and the photon?
- S: Not really.
- A: Ok, well the spin is an intrinsic property of every particle and it is sort of like an intrinsic, well, spin. As if the electron was rotating on itself. But, it is not really, since, as far as we know, the electron has no size.
- S: Not the clearest explanation I have heard.
- A: True, but spin is hard to explain. Suffice it to say, it is an intrinsic property of all particles. The photons have spin 1.
- S: Ok, so what? What does this have to do with sharing states?
- A: Well first, every particle that has spin has to be in a spin state. For the electron there are two such states, which we call spin up and spin down. Think of it as spinning counterclockwise or clockwise.
- S: And same for photons?
- A: No, photons have 3 states, which we denote as 1, 0 and -1. For any spin, you can find the number of possible states by reducing by 1 until you reach the negative spin.
- S: Seems all arbitrary.
- A: It's not really. Spin is a quantum number just like the energy level n was. When we say the electron has spin 1/2 we mean it has spin 1/2 or -1/2 while the photon has spin 1, 0 or -1. All separated by an integer. And now we get to this fundamental law of nature.

> _A particle with half-integer cannot be in the same state while a particle with integer spin can._

So for an atom with multiple electrons, we quickly fill up the low-level orbitals and we must put electrons in the higher energy orbitals. In the first energy level, we can put on two electrons (for spin up and spin down). At level 2, there is another quantum number availableâ€”remember that we have been using only n but really, the wave are in three dimensions so there are three quantum numbers; it turns out you can put six electrons in the second level of energy. And so forth...

The fact that electrons can't stand each other and must always be in differente states is the reason why atoms have volume. It helps to explain all the periodic table special properties.

The subject of ethics is a class (or many classes) of its own. Here we consider the simple working definition of ethics:

Ethics is_: "The study of the normative values and principles that govern good behavior."_

In this class we will be interested in identifying the ethical issues in scientific behavior. You will need to be able to determine when an act is right or wrong; what kind of behavior is good or desirable; and when a person deserves blame, reward, or neither.

Sometimes, scientific ethics mixes with ethical issues in society.

Scientific Ethics
-----------------

Science is a community based on trust.

> _"The only ethical principle which has made science possible is that the truth shall be told all the time..."_  
>  C.P. Snow "The Search" 1959

Like many other professions, professional physicists abide by a professional code. The three most important "**scientific crimes**" are:

1. **Falsification**: There are many ways to falsify data in order to get the result you want, all of which are "scientific crimes." For example, you could trim the data to smooth irregularities and make the data look very accurate and precise. One could "cook" the data: discard some of the results you don't like.
2. **Fabrication**: Making up results is a "scientific crime". Somebody who literally forges data by inventing results from experiments that were never performed is committing a "scientific crime".
3. **Plagiarism**: The misappropriation of another individual's thoughts, ideas, or writing and claiming them as your own is a "scientific crime".

Here is an example of a graph of data. The black points are the measured data points. Falsification would be the action of moving these points around in order for the graph to look better and in order to promote one scientific theory over another.

Self-Plagiarism
---------------

We discussed plagiarism in the introduction of the class, but scientists are even more serious about plagiarism than most other professions. Even self-plagiarism is frowned upon!

- S: Self-plagiarism? It sounds contradictory... How can you plagiarize yourself?
- M: If you reuse the same words or the same ideas but claim that it's new, then you are "self-plagiarising".
- S: And that's unethical?
- M: Indeed, each scientific paper that you write should be new. If you just reuse the same text over and over again and claim it to be new, you are guilty of research misconduct.
- S: Scientists are really serious about plagiarism!

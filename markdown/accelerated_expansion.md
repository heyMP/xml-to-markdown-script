Dark matter is mysterious but we have many plausible ideas for it. Any neutral particle with a sufficiently large mass is a good dark matter candidate. As we already said the neutron or the neutrino could be dark matter (they are dark because they don't have electric charge). But it turns out that neutron or neutrino would not work. They either move to fast (neutrino) or they interact with nuclear forces too often (neutron).

So we are on the lookout for a new neutral particle that could be the dark matter. The LHC is looking and many other experiments are underway. Unless, the scientific community as a whole is on a completely wrong track, we might be able to elucidate the nature of dark matter in the next 10 or 20 years.

Dark energy, on the other hand is even more mysterious.

Expansion of the Universe
-------------------------

As soon as Einstein figured out General Relativity, he applied the theory to model the Cosmos. What he found was perplexing. No matter what the Universe was made of, spacetime always ended up being dynamical, either expanding or contracting.

A typical Universe in Einstein's theory starts with some amount of matter and radiation and then the Universe expands. This expansion slows down as things dilute and if there were enough matter, the Universe would stop expanding and start contracting.

This rightfully annoyed Einstein. An expanding Universe must have a point of high density in the past (the Big Bang) and a contracting Universe will reach a point of high density in the future (the Big Crunch, see Fig. 10). Both are singular events for which the theory loses all power to predict what happens before or after.

Einstein did not like the idea of those Big Bangs and Big Crunches so he modified the original theory. He added a new term called the cosmological constant. By choosing a very specific value for it, he was able to stop space from expanding or contracting. He then obtained a static Universe.

This was philosophically pleasing to Einstein but he later called this the biggest blunder of his life. In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe was expanding which Einstein could have **predicted** to be true if personal philosophy and belief had not convinced him to modify his theory.

An Accelerating Universe
------------------------

The Universe expands because energy stretches the spacetime tapestry. But as the Universe expands, the energy in the form of matter gets more and more diluted to a point where the driving force for expansion is insufficient and the Universe then starts contracting.

So two teams of astronomers set out to find the **rate of change** of expansion. They looked at distant supernovae (exploding stars) to measure the rate of space expansion very accurately.

The expectation was that expansion would be slowing down. What they found took the world by surprise.

They found that the expansion of the Universe is not slowing down **but actually accelerating**. Space is expanding faster and faster apart. No form of matter or radiation that we know of (but we have some ideas) could make the Universe behave this way.

To get an expansion that accelerates, you need a form of matter whose energy **does not dilute**. We call this unknown form of matter: **Dark energy**.

Normal matter dilutes. As the Universe expand, the galaxies are further away from each other. The amount of mass per volume is smaller, because the volume is bigger. Dark energy on the other hand must have the property that as the Universe expands, the energy density stays the same. This constant energy density source drives a faster and faster source of acceleration.

And the most ironic thing is that the simplest way to get an accelerating Universe is to modify General Relativity to include the cosmological constant like Einstein did originally. For a specific value of that constant, we can stop the Universe from expanding. For a bigger value, we can get the Universe to accelerate. This is not much of an explanation since nobody knows what a cosmological constant really means, and we do not know why it has the value that we measure.

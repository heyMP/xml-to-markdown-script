Controlling the Chain Reaction
------------------------------

We control the chain reaction by inserting a bar of cadmium, which absorbs the neutrons (see Fig 14).

Nuclear Waste
-------------

If it was just for U-235, nuclear waste would be small, but, of course, the fuel bar contains U-238 which can also absorb neutrons. When it does, it becomes Plutonium-239.

PU-239 can also be used in the nuclear reactor, but mostly it's a dangerous waste and we are just stuck with it. The half-life for Plutonium is

\(t_{\frac12}\) = 24,000 years

This is a horrible number. If it was 30 years half-life, than after 1000 years, all the radiation in the nuclear waste facility would be gone. But with such a long half-life (24,000 years), plutonium waste is going to remain with us for a really long time.

The overall **course objectives** are that by the end of the class you will be able to:

- Identify the relevant physics concepts behind current social, political, and economic issues. (An understanding of the science behind these issues will help you make informed decisions.)
- Draw meaningful conclusions from reading science articles.
- Spot ethical issues in scientific research and imagine options for action.
- Articulate solutions to problems in modern physics in terms of a set of concepts and how they apply.
- Draw meaningful conclusions from tables and graphs of data, or from images or videos from which data can be obtained.

We will be covering many topics within the course and there are **lessons objectives** for each of these topics. These objectives will be explicitly stated every week.

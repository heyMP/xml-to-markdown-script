Atoms are made of three basic particles.
----------------------------------------

- **Electrons**: Our good friend the electron will be with us for the whole class. The electron has no fundamental substructure as far as we know. It is truly a fundamental particle and its motion is the source of all electricity in your daily life. We will study the electron a lot in this class. It has electric charge -1, it has a mass of \(9 \times10^{-31}\)kg.
- **Protons**. The proton is much bigger and much more massive than the electron. It is not truly fundamental, it is made of something else but this won't matter for us now. It has electric charge +1 and a mass of \(1.7\times 10^{-27}\) kg. It is 2000 times heavier than the electron!
- **Neutrons**: The neutron is very much like the proton. The main crucial difference is that the neutron is electrically neutral. Its electric charge is 0 and its mass is \(1.7\times 10^{-27}\) kg.

Putting Them Together

<div class="figurelabel"><div class="figurelabel__title">Fig 3</div><div class="figurelabel__desc">Hydrogen atom is just an electron and a proton. This image is not to scale</div></div>The simplest of all atom is hydrogen. It is also the most common atom in the Universe (~ 70% of all atoms in the Universe are hydrogen). Ironically, you cannot find pure hydrogen on Earth (there is a -physics- reason for that -- see your book!).

There are two basic components of an atom. The nucleus is at the center and it is made of protons and neutrons (except for hydrogen where the nucleus is just a proton). The nucleus is heavy. Almost all the mass of an atom is in the nucleus.

Around the nucleus, electrons are zipping around. In what is called the "Bohr model" of the atom, the electrons are going around in circles (orbits) around the nucleus. This is the picture of the atom that most people are used to. It is not quite right and we will see a better picture later on but the important thing to remember is that atoms are mostly made of **nothing** **or void**. Atoms are almost all empty space. The nucleus is very very small and the image above (in Fig. 4) is deceiving. If it was to scale, you would not be able to see the nucleus.

<div class="small-6 medium-4 column right">[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=424|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]</div>The reason why electrons orbit the nucleus is because of their electric charge. They have a negative electric charge while the nucleus contain protons which have positive electric charge. Opposite attracts and so the electron wants to stick around the proton. It is always moving though so the electron does not actually collide with the nucleus (which is very very small) and instead it just hovers and orbits around it.

In addition to protons (with positive electric charge) and electrons (with negative electric charge), the nucleus contains neutrons which have neutral charge.

- Sophie: Hey Marie, I have a question.
- Marie: Shoot!
- S: So...opposite electric charges attract and this is why the electron orbits around the nucleus...
- M: Right...
- S: But then particles with the same charge should repulse themselves, right? So, what keeps the protons stuck together in the nucleus?
- M: Very good question! Indeed a proton and electron are attracted together because of the electric forces and two protons do in fact repulse each other. So what do you think is happening?

<div class="question">Q. How can protons that normally repulse each other via electric force stay put together in the nucleus?

1. [The neutrons in the nucleus push on the protons](#)**No** the neutrons are important, but they are not the reason.
2. [There is another force involved in the system.](#)**Correct**  
  M: That's right, there is another force involved. It is called the strong nuclear force and it is so strong that it overwhelms the electric force and keeps the protons bound together. This is also why the neutrons are important. If you didnâ€™t have enough neutrons (or if you had too many), the nucleus would be unstable. Usually the number of neutrons is the same as the number of protons, but you can change that a little bit and still have a stable nucleus. We will learn about the nuclear forces later on in this class.  
  S: I see. So that's why we have neutrons in there.  
  M: good question though, keep on Sophie.
3. [The protons are more massive than electrons and so gravity is important.](#)**No.** Gravity is completely negligible inside of atoms, for the protons and for the electrons
4. [It's magic.](#)**No.** Not a very scientific answer, now is it?

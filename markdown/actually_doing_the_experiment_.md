As you will demonstrate in your lab this week, the following two graphs can be obtained from the photoelectric effect experiment. In these graphs, "I" represents the electric current.

### Current versus frequency graph

This is a graph of current I of electrons versus frequency of impeding light. This figure shows that the current one gets is zero unless the light that one uses has a frequency bigger that a certain threshold value. ")

### Current vs voltage graph

![Current versus potential](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W9QM2/currentvsvoltage.jpg "Fig 10:  This is a graph of photoelectric current as function of the voltage on the battery. This figure shows another strange aspect of the photoelectric effect. As you increase the intensity of the light, you get a bit more current but the stopping potential (and thus the kinetic energy of each electrons) does not seem to change. ")

Fig. 9 shows that there is a threshold frequency \(f_0\) below which nothing happens. Fig. 10 shows that, for positive potential, I can have a large current, and for any _intensity of the light,_ the stopping potential \(V_{stop}\) remains unchanged_._

The standard idea of physics that light is a wave that excites the electrons "out of the swimming pool" explains nicely why the current (denoted I in the figures) is proportional to the intensity, but some of these experimental facts remain completely mysterious.

1. **Why is there a threshold frequency? Why does it matter what color the light is?**
2. **If the light is more intense, should it not give more energy to the electrons? Should we not then need a higher potential \(V_{stop}\) to stop them? Why is \(V_{stop}\) the same for light intensity?**

The answers to these questions changed the way we look at the world. In your lab this week, you will be asked to reproduce these graphs and to perform the photoelectric experiment. In the demos below, Prof. Leblond shows you what the real experiment looks like.

Intensity
---------

First let's look at what happens when we change the intensity.

Frequency
---------

Now, the strangest part is the frequency dependence.

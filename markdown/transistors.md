- A: So semiconductors are the raw materials for electronics. The actual machine is the transistor.
- S: I have heard the name before. What does it do?
- A: It’s a valve.
- S: That's it?
- A: No, it can do more than that, and there are many versions of it, but the main usefulness of a transistor is that it is a tiny valve with no moving parts that can be made very, very tiny.
- S: Why do electronics need the valve?
- A: When you turn the super tiny transistor on, current goes through, while when you turn it off, it stops. We denote these two states by a 0 or a 1.
- S: Oh, I see, the transistor is where the 010010 bytes of computer come from!
- A: Exactly!

<span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">Here is a very well made video by Veritasium (who has many good videos on Youtube) about the transistor. There is not much to add to the video except to say don't worry about the last part about tunneling—we have not seen that yet.</span>

<div class="question">Q. The basic transistor described in the video is made of three doped semiconductors. What is the configuration?

1. [n-n-n](#)**No.**
2. [p-n-p](#)**No.**
3. [n-p-n](#)**Correct**. By sandwiching a p-type semiconductor in between two n-type semiconductors, we stop the current. This is because we created a depletion layer at the boundary. We can easily "erase" this depletion layer by turning a voltage at the base allowing a current to go through.
4. [n-n-p](#)**No.**
 
</div>The transistor is so important to everyday life that its electronic symbol can be found on the pavement in a Portuguese University.

![Transistor symbol in the pavement of a street.](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W9QM2/transistorstreet.png "Fig 14. Electronic symbol for the transiitor found on a pavement. ")

The electronic symbol for the transistor shows the three basic components: the **source**, the **drain** and the **base**. Again the basic functioning is that by turning a voltage on the base, we turn the switch on and we let electrons go from the source to the drain (see Fig 15 and 16).

- Light is an electromagnetic wave. This is just an electric and magnetic field that oscillates. Radio waves, UV light, etc... are also electromagnetic waves. Review the name of all different type of electromagnetic waves from radio to gamma-rays.
- The intensity of a wave is the power it delivers per unit of area. It is proportional to the amplitude (A) squared.

\( I = \frac {\rm{Power}}{\rm{Area}} \)

  
 if you double the amplitude of a wave (A), the amount of enery per second per unit of area will quadruple.  
  
 \(I \propto A^2\)

- For visible light, as you change the frequency you change the color of the light.
- Greenhouse effect refers to the phenomenon that light from the sun comes in as visible and UV light and gets returned as infrared light which does not escape easily because of the greenhouse gases.
- Light, like any other wave, interfers.
- Light can be totally reflected or only partially reflected.
- The beautiful set of color on oil is a result of partial reflection and interference.
- Light is also a particle, the photon, with zero mass and no electric charge.
- In order to explain partial reflection or interference, this particle must behave in a strange way.
- The photon only moves with a certain probability. The probability of finding the photons somewhere is greater where the wave is more intense. This is the "wave-particle" concept. The wave of light tells us where we have more chance of finding the particle of light. If the wave interference and give rise to dark fringes, the probability of finding a photon in the dark fringe will be very low.

> **The probability of detecting a photon at a particular point P(x) is directly proportional to the intensity of the light wave at that point.**

\(\rm{Prob}(x) \propto I(x) \propto A(x)^2\)

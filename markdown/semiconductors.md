Band Gap
--------

We have seen how the energy levels of the electron are quantified inside of an atom. Imagine you have hydrogen in gas form where all the atoms are in their ground state. You will need 13.6 eV per hydrogen atom to free all the electrons. Once the electrons are free, you will have a hydrogen plasma and it will conduct electricity (since the electrons are free to move).

This idea of an energy gap, often called **band gap**, is what differentiates conductors from semiconductors from insulators. Fig. 13 shows the allowed band of energy for electrons in a solid material (usually crystals).

![The energy bands for the electron in a conductor overlap while they are well separated in an insulator. A semiconductor has the property of having a very small energy gap](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W9QM2/semiconductor.png "Fig 13. Quantization of energy explains why some material are conductors while others are insulators.")

In the figure, the valence band refers to electrons that are bound to the atoms while the conduction band refers to electrons that are free to move everywhere in the crystal.

The fact that there is a band gap is what allows for insulators and it follows from quantization of energy. For conductors the gap between the energy of the free electrons compares to the stuck electrons is zero. That means the electrons can be stuck or freely moving at the same energy. The freely moving electrons is what make metal conductors of electricity.

Semiconductors are materials where the band gap is small. By slightly exciting the material, we can switch a semi conductor from being an insulator to being a conductor.

<div class="question">Q. Let's say you add an atom of Phosphorus (atomic number 15) to a Silicon (atomic number 14) crystal (which is a semiconductor). Would it become more conductive or less conductive? You may want to check the [table of elements](http://www.webelements.com/) to find the difference between Phosphorus and Silicon.

1. [Less.](#)**No.** The opposite.
2. [More.](#) **Correct!** This is referred to as doping. If you add a very similar atom to the crystal that has an extra electron, this extra electron would go in the conduction band. This is called an n-type semiconductor (n stands for negative, or for extra electrons). Doping semiconductors is common to better control their properties.
3. [There will be no difference.](#)**No.** There will be.

1. [Less.](#)**No.** Seems like it should be less, right? But it's not!
2. [More.](#)**Correct!** This may seem strange but having fewer electrons actually improves conductivity. The reason for this is that if there are places in the lattice which lack electrons, neighborhood atoms can send one of their electrons to fill the **holes.** But then there will be a hole in the next atom in the lattice which can be filled again. The net result is that holes move around just like electrons. Holes are the lack of electrons and thus one can think of them as having a positive charge. This type of semiconductors is called a p-type semiconductors for positive doping.
3. [There is no difference.](#)**No.**

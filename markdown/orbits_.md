Orbits are the subject of your lab this week. To study orbits, we do not need to use Einstein's theory of gravity. Newton's theory of universal attraction is perfectly good enough.

If you launch a projectile on the surface of the Earth, you get a nice parabolic motion. An orbit is just a projectile that is unable to fall because the Earth is curving away from it (see Fig. 9).

As you launch the projectile with faster and faster speed, there comes a  point where the projectile is unable to fall on the Earth. It is in orbit.")

In order to stay in orbit, you need to move fast. The closer the orbit, the faster you need to go. The orbital velocity can be figured out using Newton's law of gravity. The formula is the following

\(v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}\)

where \(G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\; N\;m^2/kg^2\) is Newton's constant. M is the mass of the planet you are orbiting around and r is the distance between the satellite/moon and the center of that planet.

You do not need to memorize the formula. The main point but is that the closer the orbit is (smaller r) the faster you need to move!

Instead of velocity, we often like to talk about period (T). The period tells us how long it takes the satellite/moon to go around once. The orbiting period is just the distance traveled in one turn divided by the speed.

\(T = 2\pi r/v\)

If you substitute the velocity above you will find the following important relationship (known as Kepler's third law).

> The period squared of an orbit goes like the distance cube of that orbit. Johannes Kepler discovered this law empirically before Newton invented the law of gravity. The law states that \( T^2 \propto r^3\). The farther away you are in orbit, the longer your period is.

### Low Earth Orbits (LEO)

In order to be in orbit for a long time, you need to get out of the atmosphere to eliminate drag. The lowest orbits are about hundred miles high just where the atmosphere ends. For example, the International Space Station is in low Earth orbit, it is about 400 km high. The Hubble space telescope is also in LEO.

The velocity for LEO is 8 km/s (of 5 miles/s), which is about 18,000 mi/h!! At this speed, LEO satellites go around the Earth in only 90 minutes!

It is believed that there exist many spy satellites in LEO. Being so closed to the Earth means they can take very detailed images. The drawback is that the spy satellite moves so fast that it is above the target for only a short amount of time. You can counter that drawback by having very many spy satellites so that there is always one above each target that you want to spy on!

### Geosynchronous Orbits

There is a special orbit where the satellites travel slowly enough that their period is 24 hours, the same as the rotation of the Earth. This happens at a distance of about 22,000 miles above the surface of the Earth. If you align the orbit to be centered with the equator, this result in a satellite which is stationary with respect to a point on the Earth. These satellites are always in the same place in the sky. For example, you could put your satellite such that it is always visible for people in the United States.

The geosynchronous orbit is where the great majority of communication satellites are. In fact, it is getting crowded on this orbit and spots on are very prized!

In the movie below, you can see most of the known (non-military) satellites. Most of them are on the geosynchronous orbit. The movie starts really slow, you may want to skip to 30 seconds into the movie.

Last week, we discussed how light can be thought to be made of a bunch of particles with energy

\(E = hf\)

where _h_ is known as Planck's constant. The frequency _f_ is the number of cycle per second that we would measure if we thought of light as a wave. Note how strange this is, a property of the wave, the frequency, determines the energy of the particle...

Planck's constant is a small number equal to \(h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\) J \(\cdot \) s. The units of _h_ are Joules times second. The particle of light are called photons.

The photon is a fundamental particle just like the electron. As far as we know it has no substructure (it is not made of anything else). It is a fundamental particle of nature and it has the following properties:

![The photon has a mass of 0, an electric charge of 0 and a spin of 1](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/photonstats.png "Fig. 0. The photon has zero mass and zero charge. The number one below the two zeros stands for the spin which we will not study in this class. ")

1. It has a mass of 0; i.e., it is massless.<span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" role="textbox" style=""> <nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 6px; height: 0px; font-size: 126%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.216em, 1000em, 2.447em, -0.595em); top: -2.249em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="msubsup" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.406em; height: 0px;"><span style="position: absolute; top: -2.81em; left: 0em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span>
2. It has an electric charge of 0; i.e., it is (electrically) neutral.

'Member the electron? The photon is similar yet different.

<div class="question">Q. In terms of purely particle properties, what is the energy of the photon. Do not use E=hf since f is a property of the wave.

1. [E = 0 because it has no mass.](#)**No.** Photons do carry energy (that's how the sun's energy gets to the earth!).
2. [E = potential energy of all kinds but no kinetic energy because it has no mass.](#)**No.**
3. [E = pc, where p is the momentum.](#)**Correct!** Massless particles like the photon have energy and momentum. It follows from the energy relation of relativity with m=0 (see week 5 summary).
4. [It is just not well defined.](#)**No.** It is well defined.
 
</div><div class="question">Q. What happens to a photon in an electric field?

1. [Because the photon is the particle of light (which is an E&M wave), the photon will make the field oscillate.](#)**No.** Try again!
2. [The photon disappears.](#)**No.** That would be sad.
3. [The photon creates new photon out of the electric field.](#)**No.** That would be cool but no.
4. [Nothing happens.](#)**Correct!** Nothing happens to a photon in an electric field because the photon is electrically neutral. The electric field creates a force \(F = qE\) on charged particles with charge q (with E the electric field, not energyâ€”sorry for the notation). The photon is neutral, so no force is exerted. A force is a change in momentum. No force, no change in momentum. Since \(E=pc\), no change in momentum, no change in energy. So nothing happens.
 
</div>But light -as we have seen in week 4- is an electromagnetic wave. This was demonstrated in your first lab where you saw dark and bright fringes after light went through a double slit. These dark and bright fringes resulted from constructive and destructive interference.

How can we reconcile the result of our first lab if light is a particle? This week we will see another typical wavy behavior of light which is called thin-film interference (oil slick). Our goal this week is to explain the thin film interference and the double slits experiments with a theory that reconcile light as a wave and as a particle.

But before we do that, we need a quick "review" about probability!!

Classify the electric behavior of material given the triboelectric chart.




The Triboelectric Series
------------------------

Some materials lose electrons while other gains electrons when rubbed. It all depends on the exact atomic structure of the material and to this day, this transfer is not particularly well understood. We know which way materials go based on experiments. On the right you can see a list of materials. The ones in blue like to lose electrons and acquire net positive charge while the materials in red do the opposite.

<div class="question">Q. What happens if you rub a balloon in your hair?

1. [both become +](#)**No.** Electrons must flow from one to the other.
2. [both become -](#)**No.** Electrons must flow from one to the other.
3. [balloon +, hair -](#)**No.** Look at Fig. 1
4. [balloon -, hair +](#)Correct! The balloon is made of rubber. Hair likes to loses electrons (blue on Fig 1) and rubber likes to gain electrons (red on Fig 1). So the balloon becomes negative while your hair becomes positive.

- M: If you bring a positively charged object near a neutral can of soda on its side, we can move it without touching it.
- S: Really? how?
- M: You can try this at home. If its a dry day. Take a ballon and rub it in you hair. Bring the balloon close (without touching!) to the soda can. You should be able to make it move!
- S: I don't get it. If its neutral the electric force should be zero.

Look at the picture below:

![animation showing movement of electrons in a conductor](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W5electron/movingconductor.gif "Fig. 5 Bringing a charge object near a soda can made of metal leads to a separation of charge. We can then move the can without touching it!")

In a conductor, some of the electrons are free to move, they are not stuck to the atoms. If I bring a positvely (say) charged object (like a rod) near the conductor, the electrona will move to get closer to it (since they are attracted). There will be a net negative charge on the right and there will be a lack of electron on the left creating a positive charge there. When I move the rod back, the force of attraction is big enough to move the soda can!

- S: Interesting. What happen if I use a negatively charged object?

<div class="question">Q. What do you think will happen if I bring a negatively charged object?

1. [the soda can will be repulsed](#)**No.** Try again!
2. [the soda can will be attracted](#)**Correct!** The electrons will now move to the left and the right side will be positive charge. Since the rod is negative charge, the resulting force is still attractive.
3. [the soda can will not move](#)**No.** Try again!

</div></div>1. Apply the right hand rule to determine the direction of a magnetic field given a loop of current.

- S: Pretty similar looking. Hey what is the dot and x on the loop of wire?
- M: Oh, this is important. The dot means the current is going **out** of the webpage (toward your face right now) while the x means the current is going **into** the webpage. The direction of the B field is important, and we have a rule to remember it: it is called the **right-hand rule**.
- S: I am left-handed.
- M: Sorry. Too bad.

 **Right hand rule**<span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">: Curl fingers in direction of current, thumb points in direction of B field at center of loop (see Fig 15).</span>

- M: This takes some practice, look at the following current loop on its side.

<div class="question">Q. In which direction is the magnetic field?

2. [![south down north](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W5electron/ansB.png)](#)Response to when Answer 2 is selected
3. [![North down south](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W5electron/ansC.png)](#)Correct! By curling your fingers in the direction of current your thumb should be pointed up. This means that up is a north pole.

The main idea of the photoelectric effect
-----------------------------------------

Just to review, the basic idea of the photoelectric experiment is as follows.

> _By sending light on a metal target we see that electrons are ejected. These electrons create a detectable current. By applying a counter voltage we can change the current, and determine both the number of electrons ejected and their individual energy. By shining light with different frequency and various intensities, we can study in detail the interaction between light and electrons._

This seemingly simple experiment led to one of the most profound discoveries in physics. So we will spend this whole week looking at this in more detail.

You can download the simulation in the resources below. Fig 1 shows the basic setup. In the video, Prof. Leblond goes through the basic ideas of this experiment.

We shine light on a target. This eject electrons and we measure how much energy these electrons have. ")

Important Characteristics of the Photoelectric Effect
-----------------------------------------------------

1. The current is directly proportional to the light intensity. If the light intensity is doubled, the current doubles.
2. The current appears without delays.
3. There is a threshold (minimum) frequency below which there is no current, no matter how intense.
4. This threshold frequency depends on the metal used as target.
5. By applying a reverse voltage, we can stop the current. The voltage necessary is referred to as **Stopping Potential \(V_{stop}\).**
6. The value of \(V_{stop}\) does not change as we change the intensity. But it does change as we change the frequency.

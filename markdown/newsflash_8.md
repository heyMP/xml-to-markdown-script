The news article for this week is about whether the LHC was (or still is?) going to destroy the world! This was a question born out of misunderstanding. Most of the proponents had irrational fears about the LHC. As you may know, the LHC has been running now for a few years, and well, ... we are still here!

### Ethics of Science, the Precautionary Principle

The precautionary principle is an important principle often quoted in making laws in many countries. In a nutshell, the principle is

**If an action (or policy) has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment.  
The burden of proof that the action is safe falls on the people that want to take the action.**

Using the precautionary principle, as a scientist, you can be _morally_ allowed to publish sooner your results (without all the verifications) when it is a matter of public safety.

On the opposite spectrum, if the scientists are the ones posing a danger to the planet than the burden of proof than what they plan to do is safe falls on them. In the case of the LHC, the scientists had the burden of proof. They had to show that turning on the machine would not, without any chances and without any doubts, destroy the world.

But this raises some ethical issues. Rest assured that the particle physics community has put considerable thoughts in the case of the LHC, and we convinced ourselves that it is perfectly safe.

### The discovery of the Higgs particle. 

As you probably have heard, the LHC was turned on, producing invaluable data for quite a while now, and the Higgs boson was discovered as expected! (maybe unexpected ones are to come?).

I recommend this short video by Brian Greene on the Higgs field and the Higgs particle.

Again lets repeat the main message about magnetism that you should remember.

**A changing electric field E creates a magnetic field B**

and

**A changing** **magnetic field B** **creates an** **electric field E**

The first is how a current of electrons can create an electromagnet. The latter is the key to understand the electric generator and the transformer.

Let's explore this last concept with the following JAVA simulation. You can either click on the picture below but if that does not work you can also download the simulation directly from [here](http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/faraday/faraday_en.jar) or at the [Phet website](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/faraday).

First, look at the bar magnet and move it around. You can see how the magnetic field (represented by small compasses at each point in space) changes. _At each point in space the magnetic field has some value and some direction._
2. Second, look at the pickup coil tab, try to move the bar magnet. As you move the bar magnet around, the magnetic field in the wire of the coil changes. As the magnetic field changes, it creates an electric field that then imparts a force on the electron and makes it move. We get a current, the light bulb lights up!

<div class="question">Q. From the simulation can you tell in which situation would the light shine brighter?

1. [move bar magnet slowly above the light bulb.](#)**No.** Quick is better than slow
2. [move bar magnet quickly above the light bulb](#)**No.** Inside the coil is better than outside.
3. [move bar magnet slowly inside the coil](#)**No.** Quick is better than slow
4. [move bar magnet quickly inside the coil](#)**Correct!** The biggest electric field and thus current is created by changing the B field quickly and moving the bar magnet through the coil.

</div>1. Now look at the electromagnet tab. There you will find a battery that generates a current through many coils of wire. This electromagnet behaves in exactly the same way as the bar magnet in the first tab! If you change the polarity of the current by changing the sign of the voltage on the battery you can reverse the north and south pole of the magnet (look at the red and white parts of the compass). If you stop the current by reducing the battery voltage to 0. The magnetic field will disappear everywhere.

Generator
---------

<div>M: The last two tabs are what make our electric grid possible. First, let's look a the generator. Go to the last tab and turn the faucet.</div><div>S: Okay. I guess the water turns the bar magnet continuously, which then creates a current.</div><div>M: Yes. The faster the magnet turns, the more current. </div><div></div><div></div><div class="question">Q. What type of current is generated this way?

1. [AC current](#)**Correct!** Indeed the current alternates constantly and changes direction. An electric generator naturally generates alternating current. A battery gives direct current but all generators and power plants give rise to AC current.
2. [DC current](#)**No.** Look carefully at the simulation
3. [a mixture of both](#)**No.** What is that?

</div>- S: So, that's why we use AC.
- M: Well, actually, there is a more important reason....

Transformer
-----------

Finally, look at the transformer tab of the simulation. At first nothing should be going on but if you go to the right and change the source from DC to AC, you should now see the light bulb light up, but only weakly.

The reason the light bulb lights up is because the AC current constantly changes the B field which then creates a current in the other loop. But, the number of coils in each loop is different and thus the current and voltage are also different (see Fig. 8).

This is a great tool as it allows us to change the voltage very efficiently.

![transformer ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W5electron/Transformer.png "Fig 8. A transformer has an iron core with a wire wrapping on one side (so-called the primary) and another wrapping the other side (the secondary). Different number of turns results in different voltages and currents on each side. ")

- S: This is pretty cool! So, the current goes in on the left (the red) and it goes on the blue, but the wires don't even touch!
- M: Yes, but there is a magnetic field in between.
- S: Isn't there some kind of flow of energy in there?
- M: Yep! The electrons coming in have kinetic energy, which they lose in creating the B field (the kinetic energy of the electron goes in the B field). The changing B field then moves the electrons in the blue loop.
- M: So, we have kinetic energy in red loop -> energy of magnetic field -> kinetic energy of electron in blue loop.
- S: Hmmm. I guess that magnetic field is a real thing then! In the following demo, I will show you a transformer in action!

The reason the electric grid uses AC current:
---------------------------------------------

![pole mount transformer for residential use](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W5electron/Polemount-singlephase-closeup.jpg "Fig 9. A transformer near residential areas. ")

... is the transformer (See Fig 9). To minimize loss in power when we transport electricity over large distances it is better to use high voltage (i.e., low current).

But in your house, high voltage would be dangerous and unusable. Fortunately, it is easy to change the voltage using a transformer like the one you see in Fig 9.

The transformer only works with AC current and this is ultimately why that's the current we get in our house!

Periodic Table of Elements

You can see in this picture the atomic number (which is just the number of protons) and the symbol. The table of elements is arranged so that atoms in the same columns have similar chemical properties. This is mostly related to how hard it is to get electrons in and out of the atom. This is very important in a chemistry class, but here we will not dwell on that.

Lesson Objectives
-----------------

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

1. Relate a changing electric field to a magnetic field and vice-versa.
2. Summarize the basic physical concepts behind an electromagnet, a generator and a transformer.
3. Discuss why the electric grid uses AC current.
4. Describe light as an oscillating electric and magnetic field and list its properties.
5. Employ the relation between intensity, power, and energy for a wave.
6. Name different types of electromagnetic waves and sort the color of light in terms of wavelength of frequency.
7. Describe radiative heat and the greenhouse effect.

Readings
--------

- This lesson
- Ch. 6, pp. 212-232. From "Magnets" up to the end of the chapter.
- Ch. 9, pp. 324-345. From the beginning of the chapter up to (but not including) "Medical Imaging." (I'd recommend reading the whole chapter because the medical applications are very interesting to me. But it's not mandatory.)

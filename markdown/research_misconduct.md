Punishment
----------

Scientists who are found guilty of research misconduct can be punished severely and are usually disgraced.

- S: This story does not fit so nicely in the FFP list (fabrication, falsification and plagiarism).
- M: Indeed, real life situations are always more murky. The real guideline is that scientists always want the truth and nothing but the truth. When somebody is listed as an author, we expect that they have contributed something.
- S: And I guess that for an independent claim to be truly independent, the main person in the original experiment should not be lurking close by.
- M: Indeed...
- S: And what about the fact that nobody could reproduce the original experiment. Isn't there something suspicious there that suggests the results were forged?
- M: Maybe... Or maybe there was something truly exceptional that happened that day and nobody knows what it was. Or the experimentalist was incompetent and somebody did a mistake. Thats not misbehavior, errors happen.

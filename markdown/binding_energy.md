The nuclear force acts very much like a box. It is a very strong force at the outskirts of the nucleus but inside the nucleus, protons and neutrons can move pretty freely (electric force mixes things up but not that much). In this class we will **model** the nucleus to be a potential energy box like in Fig 3.

![Energy diagram for the nucleus is a just a box of a certain height. Protons (blue) and neutron (red) are stuck in the box. Some protons and neutron are grouped into Helium atoms. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W10QM3nuclear/energywellnucleus2.png "Fig 3: Energy diagram for the nucleus is a just a box of a certain height. Protons (blue) and neutron (red) are stuck in the box. Some protons and neutron are grouped into Helium atoms. L is the size of the nucleus. ")

Nuclear physicists call this the **Shell Model** and, while it is rudimentary, it does capture most of the important phenomena about nuclear physics.

Average Binding Energy per Nucleon 
-----------------------------------

So the model we have for the nucleus is a box. Think of it as a swimming pool. With enough energy we can shake the water in the pool such that some water escapes out. Same thing with the nucleusâ€”we can give it enough energy to take out protons, neutrons or helium atoms (alpha particles).

We define the average binding energy as the average energy we need to shake to get some protons or neutrons out of the nucleus. **The higher the binding energy**, the harder it is to take nucleons out and **the more stable** the atom is.

![The average binding energy per nuclei is the average energy needed to get a nuclei (proton or neutron) out of the energy well and thus out of the nucleus. ](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W10QM3nuclear/averagebindingenergy2.png "The average binding energy per nuclei is the average energy needed to get a nuclei (proton or neutron) out of the energy well and thus out of the nucleus. ")

We have experimentally measured the average binding energy for nucleons in each element and the result is shown in the figure 4.

The vertical axis is the average binding energy per nucleons (think average depth in the well) while the horizontal axis displays the total number of nucleons in the nucleus (so it covers all atoms and all isotopes).  ")

<div class="question">Q. From the diagram, can you tell which nucleus is the most stable (not counting hydrogen)?

1. [Helium 4.](#)**No.** The average binding energy for helium is unusually high but it is not the highest.
2. [Oxygen 16.](#)**No.** Oxygen does not have the highest binding energy.
3. [Iron 56.](#)**Correct.** Iron is the most stable nucleus in nature with the highest average binding energy.
4. [Uranium 238](#). **No.** Uranium has lower average binding energy than iron.
 
</div>= S: Hey Alice or Bob: I have a question here.- A: Go ahead I will take it.
- S: What's up with the spike for Helium?
- A: Very good. Helium is a particularly stable atom for the number of nuclei it has. This is why in the nucleus, the protons and neutrons like to group themselves in bunches of helium nuclei. We call those **bunches of 4, the alpha particle**.
- S: So that's it. Your answer is that it just happens to be that way.
- A: Yes. This configuration of 2 protons and 2 neutrons just happens to be particularly stable.

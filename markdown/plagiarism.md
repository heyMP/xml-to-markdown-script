I would like to emphasize one part of the academic integrity principle of Penn State about plagiarism. ![no cut and paste](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/cutpaste.png)

Of course all the academic integrity principles are important (like cheating) but plagiarism is the most misunderstood. Students may plagiarize without even being aware of it and this is still a violation of academic principles.

Examples of Plagiarism
----------------------

Lets first start with some example of plagiarism

1. Submit a paper for grading that you did not write yourself
2. Copy answers or text from a colleague and submit is as your own
3. Quote or paraphrase from another paper without giving credit to the author
4. Cite data without giving credit to the original source
5. Propose someone else’s idea as if it were yours
6. Fabricate or use incorrect references
7. Submit another’s presentation, program or spreadsheet with only small changes

These are pretty clear cut violations of Penn State academic principles. What about the following case?

Carelessness Case Study
-----------------------

> _&#151;A student is accused of plagiarism in a lab report. While most of the paper appears to be original, the professor finds several paragraphs that are directly copied from a journal article, which is cited in the student’s bibliography. The student, convinced that he did not plagiarize, produces all the notes he used when writing his paper. It is discovered that the copying was a result of sloppy note taking, because the student did not distinguish between his own shorthand and the words of the article’s author in his notebook._

<div class="question">Q. Is this plagiarism?

1. [Yes](#)**Correct!** Whether you are aware of it or not does not make a difference. Plagiarism occurs whenever you use words that were writing by someone else.
2. [No](#)**No.** think again
3. [Not clear](#)**No.** Plagiarism is almost always clearly identifiable
 
</div><div class="question">Q. Is this student responsible for a violation of academic integrity, or is this merely a case of “bad study habits”?

1. [Click here for my personal opinion.](#)This is a arguably a blurry case but I **will not** give the students a chance because the real world will not give you a chance either. Joe Biden, the current US vice-president, failed a class as a student because of plagiarism. The case above is plagiarism and it does not matter whether the student did it willingly or by incompetence, he/she will have to face some consequences.
 
</div>_How to avoid this._ Be careful at how you take notes!!

Consequences of Plagiarism
--------------------------

In the real world, you can get sued, lose your job or lose your reputation. You can find on this Wikipedia [page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_plagiarism_incidents) many famous examples of plagiarism with very often dire consequences for the person who did it.

For students at Penn State, **plagiarism will** result in a lower grade

- Zero or F for the assignment
- F or XF for the course

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">**Plagiarism in this class will mostly be an issue only for the project (worth 15% of your grade). The project is not a very long text so make sure you actually type all the sentences and quote and cite appropriately. Do not copy paste anything without referencing. I will be using a special software to check that your text is original.** </div><div style="margin-left: 80px;"> </div>Images and movies on this website.

External Resources

- Wikipedia is the main source of plagiarism (and the easiest to spot). Here is a **very good** video from the PSU library: [How to use Wikipedia](https://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/tutorials/wikipedia.html).

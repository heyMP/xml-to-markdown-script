1. Calculate the quantum of energy and the ground state for an electron given a formula for its energy and the de Broglie relationship.
2. Qualitatively explain the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the various wave orbitals for electrons in an atom.
3. Interpret the half-life of an excited atom.

The hydrogen atom is the simplest possible atom. It is made of a proton with positive electric charge and an electron with negative electric charge. The two are attracted together via the electric force. We can represent the force on the electron exerted by the proton using our good friend the energy diagram.

The electric potential energy felt by an electron around a single proton is just a well that gets steeper the closer you get. Using r for the radial distance the potential energy looks like

Note that we have defined the potential energy U to be always negative. This is an arbitrary choice. It is also a useful choice although you may find it confusing. The total energy is the sum of potential plus kinetic so \(E_{tot} = U +K\). If the total energy of the electron is negative, it will not be possible to escape since there is a **turning point** in the trajectory. We say that the electron is bound. If the total energy is positive, then the electron can escape to infinity and is free of the proton. This is what happens when we ionize hydrogen and liberate the single electron. This is illistrated in the figure below.

One of the best and most beautiful evidence that we have for dark matter is the bullet cluster. This is a very special galaxy cluster and gravitational lensing analysis that was done about 10 years ago it is very revealing about dark matter.

Here is the Bullet cluster as seen with the Hubble space telescope (i.e. detecting visible light -- see Fig. 6).

Here is what the cluster looks like in X rays (superposed on top of the optical image -- see Fig. 7). The X-ray image shows the presence of gas in the galaxy that is impossible to see in the visible spectrum. The gas is very hot and the electrons are moving really fast which is why the gas emits X rays. As you can see in Fig. 7, the gas on the right has the form of a shock wave. This is where the name Bullet cluster comes from.

We see two high temperature gases that seem to have collided as we can tell by the shock wave. Strictly speaking, the name Bullet cluster refers to the smaller one (on the right). It looks like a bullet that passed through a bigger cluster of galaxy.")

Finally, Fig. 8 shows where all the mass must be as determined by gravitational lensing.

Putting it all together, we get this amazing image that clearly shows two clusters (see Fig. 9). In the image we can see the galaxies and the gases. This is a clear-cut collision between two huge galaxy clusters but most of the mass found by gravitational lensing just seemed to have passed through each other. The dark matter and the gas are separated.

So we think that what happen is that the two galaxy clusters collided, the gas interacted but the dark matter did not. Because this image clearly shows that the majority of the mass of the objects is separateed from the gas, it gives evidence for a new type of mass that we can't see.

Remember that we don't see dark matter. The blue is a fake color where we inferred the dark matter must be. We know it must be there because it forces the galaxies and the gas to orbit around it and it bends the surrounding light.

As you can see, the Bullet cluster is really two clusters that collided into one another. The galaxies are few and far apart so they just pass through each other. The intergalactic gas on the other hand interacted and we can see the shock wave. The dark matter is where most of the mass is and they just pass through each other without interacting.")

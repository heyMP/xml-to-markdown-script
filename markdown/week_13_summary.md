- The nuclear force is short range and affect protons and neutrons equally. It is stronger than the electric force and it overcomes the repulsion between protons.
- Each nuclei has some average binding energy. Some nuclei are more stable than others. Iron-56 is the most stable atom in the world. Helium is particularly stable.
- There are three types of radiation. Alpha which is just helium; Beta, which is just an electron; and Gamma, which is a photon.
- Alpha particles are emitted when a nucleus above iron spontaneously decays. Polonium is a good example.
- Gamma particles are emitted by atoms in excited states. The energy levels inside the nucleus are quantized just like the energy levels of the electrons are quantized.
- Half-life is the time it takes for half of the current number of radioactive material to decay.
- Nuclear reactors currently work on the U-235 cycle. You should be able to describe this cycle (each step).
- What is one of the radioactive wastes in nuclear reactors?
- A chain reaction is a reaction that keeps increasing and can get out of control.
- We use cadmium bars to control the chain reaction.

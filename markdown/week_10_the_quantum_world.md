Lesson Objectives
-----------------

By the end of the week you will be able to

1. Understand how the double slit experiment or the interference in oil slicks can only be explained if light is a wave.
2. Explain the dual nature of light as a wave and as a particle
3. Translate the intensity pattern of light into probabilities of finding photons.
4. Explain how one can destroy the interference pattern by determining in which slits the photons went.

Yes! This is it for the objectives, but it is pretty deep stuff!

This week we will start with the most important interaction for your daily life: electricity. Electricity is almost always caused by the movement of a single particle: the electron.

The Electron
------------

As far as we know the electron has no substructure (it is not made of anything else). It is a fundamental particle of Nature and it has the following properties:

1. It has a mass of 0.511 MeV/c\(^2\)
2. It has an electric charge of -1

- S: Hello Marie... more explanation needed here! What are these numbers supposed to mean?
- M: Yep! No problem. The first one is just the mass--what you would find if you were to put an electron on a scale.
- S: But what's up with the units?
- M: As we saw, energy and mass are really the same thing. So the mass of the electron is <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(m_e= 9.1\)<span style="white-space:nowrap;margin-left:0.25em;margin-right:0.15em">x</span> \(10^{-31} \)kg</span> (which is pretty small) but we could also say that the mass of the electron is \(m_e = 8.01 \times 10^{-14} J/c^2\). This is an energy in Joules and we divided by the speed of light squared to get a mass.
- S: Okay. So MeV is a unit of energy?
- M: Yes. We will learn the definition of this unit this week. MeV is a mega electron-volt (\(10^6 \; eV\) ) and an electron-volt is \(1\; \rm{eV} = 1.6\times 10^{-19}\) joules. Also, we often omit the factor of \(c^2\) since we all know it should be there. So--we end up saying that the electron has a mass of 0.511 MeV. By comparison, the proton has a mass in these units of \(m_p = 938\) MeV.
- S: I see, what about the charge?

Electric Charge
---------------

The electromagnetic force acts on every particle that is charged. As we saw in week #1, the electron has one unit of negative electric charge. The proton has one unit of positive electric charge and the neutron is neutral and has zero electric charge. This means that the neutron does not feel the electric force while the electron and the proton do.

Experiments show that all charges that we see comes in integer units of an **elementary charge**  _e_.

_e_\(= 1.602\times10^{-19}\) Coulombs

where Coulombs is the unit for charge (name after a physicist called Coulomb). So the electron really has a charge of -_e_ while the proton is +_e_ but we often just say -1 and +1 where the 1 means 1 unit of the elementary charge e.

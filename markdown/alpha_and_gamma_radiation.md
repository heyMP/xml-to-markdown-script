- A: Alright, we have all the tools to understand the first two basic types of nuclear radiation. Alpha decay and gamma decay. Let's start with alpha.

<span>Let us summarize:</span>

1. The nucleus is an energy well. The source of this energy is the nuclear force which is stronger than the electric repulsion between the protons, but it is very short range.
2. Each nucleus has some average binding energy. Helium is unusually stable and so protons and neutrons like to group themselves in bunches of four (helium or alpha particle) inside the nucleus.
3. The most stable atom is iron. Atoms below iron would like to grab some alpha particles, but this is very rare. Atoms bigger than iron can eject an alpha particle to become more stable.
4. Alpha particles are stuck inside the potential well but sometimes they can randomly get out of the nucleus (see Fig 6). (This is due to quantum tunneling which we will not cover in this classâ€”[look here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTodS8hkSDg) if you want to learn more about it)

Polonium PO 84 
---------------

Let's look at an example. Polonium is a highly radioactive element discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie. Its atomic number is 84 (this means it has 84 protons). There are no stable isotopes of Polonium. For every number of neutrons, polonium is highly radioactive mostly to alpha decay.

For example, polonium 208 (84 protons and 124 neutrons) is radioactive. It emits an alpha particle and becomes lead Pb 204 which is very stable. Note that the total number of nuclei dropped by four and that polonium (element 84) became lead (element 82) (so two less protons). See the [table of elements](http://www.webelements.com) to check for yourself. Marie Curie spend her life studying radioactive materials and she won a Nobel prize in physics _and_ chemistry in recognition of her work. (Very, very few people have ever done that.)

Unfortunately, she died of cancer. Her lab notebook and other furniture from her lab, are being kept in Paris but they cannot be seen by the public because they are too radioactive and unsafe still to this day!

- S: Why would the notebook be radioactive, it is not made of Polonium?
- A: No, but it contains traces of polonium (or other radioactive materials that Curie discovered).
- S: It is sad that she died because of her research.
- A: Well you can die of cancer for other causes, but, yes, she was in contact with many dangerous materials. Now we do nuclear research much more safely and Marie lives on thru the many discoveries she made!

Gamma Radiation 
----------------

The other type of nuclear radiation is a photon. To understand why, we need to go back to the [electron in a box](https://online.science.psu.edu/phys010_wd/node/11575). You will remember that when you put a particle in a box, its energy is quantized (see Fig 7).

![](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W10QM3nuclear/energybox2.png "Fig 7: Energy of an electron in a box is quantized. ")

The energy in the square box goes like \( E_n = n^2 E_1\), where \(E_1\) is the ground state energy which depends on the size of the box. The ground state energy goes like \(E_1 \propto 1/L^2\), the smaller the nucleus (L) the bigger the energy. Because the nucleus is so much smaller than the atom, the ground state energy is bigger and the energy of the photon emitted is bigger as well.

A typical electron transition creates photons with energy of about 1 eV. Via \(E=hf\), this amount of energy corresponds to frequencies of about \(10^{14}\) Hz, or visible light.

A typical nuclei transition inside the atom create photons with energy of about \(10^6\) eV which are gamma rays.

<div class="question">Q. What would be the frequency for gamma radiation when an alpha particle makes a transition inside the nucleus?

1. [\(10^{14}\) Hz](#)**No.** Too small.
2. [\(10^{20}\) Hz](#)**Correct.** The energy difference between two levels inside of the nucleus is about \(10^6\) eV (or 1 MeV). The frequency of the photon is just given by Einstein's formula \(E = hf\). If the energy is \(10^6\) times bigger than of the electron, the frequency is also \(10^6\) times bigger. So \(10^{14}\) Hz for electrons in atoms becomes \(10^{20}\) Hz for alpha particles in the nucleus.
3. [\(10^{25}\) Hz](#)**No.** Too big.
4. [Question does not make sense.](#)**No.** It does make sense.

Mass Defect 
------------

Let's say that an atom decays from an excited state and emits a 1 MeV gamma ray. The atom is at rest at the beginning and it recoils a bit, but not very much. So where does the energy came from?

It came from the mass. An excited atom that emits a 1 MeV gamma ray weighs more before than after. The atom loses mass. Exactly as predicted by \(E=mc^2\).

Same thing when polonium emits an alpha particle. The mass of the alpha particle plus the final lead atom is less than the original mass of the polonium. The mass difference between the end products and the beginning all goes into kinetic energy of the alpha particle and the lead atom.

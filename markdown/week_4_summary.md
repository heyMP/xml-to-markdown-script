- Waves can cancel and reinforce. (This is called interference.)
- When two waves with different shapes meet, you can just add the shapes directly on top of each other.
- You should be able to recognize the interference pattern of a single slit and a double slit and explain the physics behind those images.
- When a wave is confined or constrained, only a discrete set of vibration modes are allowed. These are called standing waves. For the case of a string of length L pinned at both ends, or a tube, the wavelengths are:

\(\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}\)

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . where n is the harmonic number.

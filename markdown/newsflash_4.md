Here is a figure of the experiment. Neutrinos are produced at the CERN lab in Geneva. They zip through the Earth and arrive at the OPERA detector in Italy. They know the distance between the two labs very well. By dividing the distance by the time, they can figure out the speed of the neutrinos.

The expectation is that neutrinos move at the speed of light, but this measurement was going to test this idea.

<div class="question">Q. From reading the article, what is the time delay (ns stands for nanosecond or \(10^{-9}\) seconds)?

1. [Neutrinos arrive faster than light by a time of \(60\; ns\).](#)**No.** Read more carefully.
2. [Neutrinos arrive faster than light by a time of \( 60\; ns + 10 \; ns\).](#)**No.** The error can go both ways.
3. [Neutrinos arrive faster than light by a time of \( 60\; ns \pm 10 \; ns\).](#)**Correct!** Indeed there is a 10 ns uncertainty, so the OPERA experiment is telling us that the delay could be between 50 ns and 70 ns. But even including the uncertainty, they had a result that implied that neutrinos were faster than light.
4. [Neutrinos arrive faster than light by a time of \( 60\; ns - 10 \; ns\).](#)**No.** The error can go both ways.

</div>The Scientific Process
----------------------

This is a huge claim: Einstein's theory of special relativity says that the speed of light is the fastest you can go. In order to test whether the anomaly was correct, two things needed to be done:

- Do another completely independent measurement of the same thing. This is to duplicate results and eliminate the possibilities of unknown systematic errors related to the particular set-up used in the OPERA experiment.
- Triple check and recheck everything...

As it turns out they did the second one before another experiment was set-up and they found this

<div class="question">Q. Answer to Opera.

1. [Reveal](#)![opera fiber plug before and after](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W4spacetime/operafiberplug1.png)
  
  One of the fiber optic cables was not set in completely. This caused a time error in the electronics. Fixing this, the OPERA recalculated the speed of neutrino and found that the time delay was now -1.7 ns with a statistical uncertainty of 3.7 ns. This is consistent with zero (no difference between the speed of light and the speed of neutrino).

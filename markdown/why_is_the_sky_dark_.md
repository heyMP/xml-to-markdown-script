This is the last week! You have learned a lot of physics in this class but with more knowledge always comes more questions. As we will see this week, it turns out that 95 % of the Universe is made of dark matter and dark energy and we don't know what those two "dark" components are! So you now have enough knowledge in physics to explain how we don't know what 95% of the Universe is!

This is a strange point in the history of science. On the one hand, our theories of the Universe have never been so successful. The theory of quantum mechanics (the particle/wave) and of relativity have been verified to hold to unprecedented accuracy. We understand (in varying degrees) all four fundamental forces with electromagnetism being the most understood and the strong nuclear and gravity being the trickier ones.

So physics as a science is rocking and yet when we look at the Cosmos we come back baffled. Most of the energy and matter in the Universe is in the form of dark energy and dark matter. We don't know what this dark stuff is. We don't even know if it is just some new type of particle/wave or some completely new building block of Nature.

Of the two, dark matter is the one we are the closest to making some tangible progress in finding out what it is. Dark energy is more mysterious and more thought provoking.

Let us first start with the beginning, before dark matter and dark energy comes a more fundamental and seemingly simple question. Why is the sky dark?

Look at this fun video from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical physics in Canada.

If the Universe is infinite with an infinite amount of stars, the sky should always be bright. This is known as Olbers' paradox. We don't know if the Universe is infinite in size. This is one (of the many) outstanding question we are trying to find out. But as the video showed, we do know that the Universe is evolving and stars have not been there forever. There was a time when there were no stars.

The sky is dark because we can only see the stars for which the light had time to reach us since their formation! T**he reason the sky is dark is not because of dark matter or dark energy!** As we look further in the Universe, we see light that was emitted further in the past. We see stars and galaxies in their younger stages (see Fig 1). With our best telescope, we can see the very first structure in our Universe!

Expansion and the Big-Bang.
---------------------------

The Universe is evolving in time. Star first formed, we grow old and galaxies and stars grow old.

In addition to this time evolution we found at the end of week 14 that the Universe is expanding. This is in and of itself a pretty provoking idea so let us look a bit more into what it means.

First this is a space expansion but you cannot feel it.

The fact that space can expand is a natural consequence of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. It is a "natural consequence" when spacetime becomes dynamical but it is pretty strange and Einstein refused to believe it at first. The problem is that if you run the clock backward in an expanding Universe, you find that in the past everything had to be closer together. There must be a point where everything we see was on top of each other. This is referred to as the Big Bang and given the measured rate of expansion, we believe that this singular Big Bang happened about 13.6 billions years ago.

This is all fine except that we don't know what "banged" in the Big Bang. It is also a point where Einstein's theory fail to make good predictions. The theory is singular because the energy density becomes extremely large. There must be another theory that takes over at this point. Speculative theories like string theory may do the job but it is too early to tell.

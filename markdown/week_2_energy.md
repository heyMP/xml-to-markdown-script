Lesson Objectives
-----------------

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

1. List various forms of energy and various units used for energy.
2. Compare and be able to measure various sources of energy in your daily life (compare energy per gram for each source).
3. Compare and contrast Power versus Energy.
4. Recall that energy of motion, kinetic energy, depends on the mass of the object and the square of the speed of the object, or \( K = \frac12 mv^2\).
5. Summarize the concept of thermal energy as kinetic motion of atoms. You should be able to define all four states of matter and how one can undergo phase transitions from one phase to another.
6. Illustrate the principle of conservation of energy with examples.

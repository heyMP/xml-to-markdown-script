So we have seen that electrons (and other matter particles) are described by a wave. We call this wave the wavefunction and we use the symbol

\(\psi(x)\)

to describe it. If matter particles are described by a wave, what does this wave look like?

Well, first of all, it is usually constrained to a small location. When we talked about wave earlier, we used to talk about wave of fixed wavelength and frequency, like in Fig. 2 below.

The real wave associated with an electron looks more like the Fig. 3: this is called a wavepacket. If you squared the amplitude of the wavepacket at a given in point in space you will get the probability of finding the particle at that point. For a sine wave, that is going on forever you could find the particle anywhere really but for a wavepacket, chances are that you will find the particle in a small region \(\Delta x\) where the wavepacket is not zero.

You can think of wavepacket had being the sum of a bunch of wave with different wavelength \(\Delta \lambda\) as you can see in the animation below.

![construction of a wavepacket from manu waves](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/Sequential_superposition_of_plane_waves.gif)

The more waves we use to construct the wavepacket, the more localized in space we can make it.

But we know from the de Broglie relationship that each standard oscillatory wave with a fixed wavelength (Fig. 2) corresponds to a fixed momentum \(\lambda = h/p\).

<span>Since a wavepacket is made by combining multiple waves with a range of wavelength. This means that a particle that is described by a wavepacket really has a </span>**range**<span> of momentum \(\Delta p\) just like it has range of position \(\Delta x\).</span>

One can show mathematically, that in order to localize a wave in space (a wavepacket in a small range \(\Delta x\) ), you need to sum a bigger range of momentum. This is known as the uncertainty principle. In equation (with numbers included) this says,

\(\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{2}\)

> **The more precisely we know the position, the more uncertain we are about the momentum.**

This is not magic, it just a property of waves. Note that you do not need to know the equation, just the concept.

<div class="question"><span>Q. For which one of these two waves, can you locate the particle better? Take the x axis to be the same scale in both images. </span>

1. [![one bump wavelenght](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/HeisenbergA.png)](#)**Correct!** This image has a smaller extent (slightly) than wave B.
2. [![many bumps, same extend](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W8photon-electron/HeisenbergB.png)](#)No! but close. The two waves have almost the same extent. The wavelength does not matter but visually you can tell that the range for wave A is slightly smaller.
3. [<span>either one have the same \(\Delta x\)</span>](#)No but close! <span style="line-height: 20.4px; background-color: initial;">The two waves have almost the same extent. The wavelength does not matter but visually you can tell that the range for wave A is slightly smaller.</span>

The news article for this week is about whether the LHC was (or still is?) going to destroy the world! This was a legitimate question although most of the proponents had irrational fears about the LHC. As you may know, the LHC has been running now for a couple of years, and well, ... we are still here!

### Ethics of Science, the Precautionary Principle

The precautionary principle is an important principle often quoted in making laws in many countries. In a nutshell, the principle is

**If an action (or policy) has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment.  
 The burden of proof that the action is safe falls on the people that want to take the action.**

Using the precautionary principle, as a scientist, you can be _morally_ allowed to publish sooner your results (without all the verifications) when it is a matter of public safety.

On the opposite spectrum, if the scientists are the ones posing a danger to the planet than the burden of proof than what they plan to do is safe falls on them. In the case of the LHC, the scientists had the burden of proof. They had to show that turning on the machine would not, without any chances and without any doubts, destroy the world.

But this raises some serious ethical issues. The LHC is about to discover new physics, we don't know anything about this new physics. **How can we be sure that the LHC will not destroy the world?**

- The most important concept this week was  
   â€¢ **A changing electric (magnetic) field creates a magnetic (electric) field**
- You should be able to explain the basic working of a generator, a transformer and an electromagnet.
- Why does the electric grid uses AC current? What are the main vulnerabilities of our electric grid that can cause a failure like we saw in 2003?
- Light is an electromagnetic wave. This is just an electric and magnetic field that oscillates. Radio waves, UV light, and microwaves are also electromagnetic waves.
- The intensity of a wave is the power it delivers per unit of area.
- For visible light, as you change the frequency, you change the color of the light.
- Greenhouse effect refers to the phenomenon that light from the sun comes in as visible and UV light and gets returned as infrared light, which does not escape easily because of the greenhouse gases.
- Light, like any other wave, interferes.

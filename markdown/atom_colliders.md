If an electron and a positron meet, they annihilate. Assuming that they are not moving, all their energy just comes from their mass \(E=mc^2\). The mass of the electron (and the positron) is 0.5 MeV\(/c^2\) and so the energy released in one annihilation of a (non-moving) electron-positron pair is 1 MeV. I remind you that eV is just a unit of energy.

1 MeV is 1 Mega electron volt which is 1.6\(\times 10^{-13} J\)

which may not be a lot in day-to-day life, but it is a fair amount of energy to give to a single particle.

<div class="question">Q. If the electron and positron at rest annihilate and transfer their energy to a single photon, what will be the frequency of that photon? I remind you that \(E=hf\) with \(h \approx 4 \times 10^{-15}\) ev s

1. [\(0.25 \times 10^6\) Hz](#)**No.** Not quite, the energy of electron/positron is \(10^6\) eV.
2. [\(0.25 \times 10^{10}\) Hz](#)**No.** Not quite, the energy of electron/positron is \(10^6\) eV.
3. [\(0.25 \times 10^{15}\) Hz](#)**No.** Not quite, the energy of electron/positron is \(10^6\) eV.
4. [\(0.25 \times 10^{21}\) Hz](#)**Correct!** Just divide the energy by h. So \(10^6\) ev/(4\(\times 10^{-15}\) ev s) = 0.25 \(\times 10^{21}\) Hz. Looking at the figure below (look a the frequency bar), you can see that the photon produced has to be a strong gamma-rays (we will see more about those when we get to nuclear radiation).

</div>The goal of an accelerator of particles is to move particles to higher and higher energy (by increasing their momentum). As we saw in week 5, the energy of a particle is given by the relation.

\(E^2 = m^2c^4 + p^2c^2\)

By increasing the momentum p, the energy increases. When accelerated electrons and positrons annihilate at high energy, we can explore new regimes of energy and produce new particles beyond the photon!

### Large Hadron Collider

Over the years, we have built many different particle accelerators. The latest, baddest and strongest machine is the Large Hadron Collider.

This is a 27 km long underground ring in which we accelerate protons and antiprotons until they go at nearly the speed of light. Their momentum grows to huge values and in fact the energy due to their motion is much more important than their mass energy (the \(p^2\) term in the formula for energy dominates). The LHC accelerates protons until they have roughly the energy of the order of

> 1 TeV or \(10^{12}\) eV. This is a million times the energy of the mass of the electron.

Once in a while, the protons are allowed to annihilate with the antiprotons (going the opposite way in the beam). The collisions occur at four different sites where we have big (really big) experiments and detectors such as CMS and Atlas (see Fig 2).

At these locations, the protons and antiprotons are allowed to collide and one gets a shower of new particles (see Fig 3). Among the mess, physicists are trying to find new clues about the underlying structure of the Universe.

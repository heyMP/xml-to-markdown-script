Momentum like energy is a conserved quantity.

To talk about conservation of a physical quantity, we need to be careful to define a system. This is arbitrary, you choose what the system will be.

A quantity is conserved if it impossible to destroy or create it **from within the system**.

It is always possible to transfer energy or momentum in or out of the system. This does not violate the conservation principle but if we do get transfer in or out, then the physical quantity will not be constant. If there is no transfer then the energy/momentum will be truly constant.

A good analogy is money. The money in your bank account is a conserved quantity. You cannot create it or destroy it. You can change its form from checking to saving, you can transfer out by buying stuff and you can transfer in by receiving your paycheck. The amount of money is not constant but, as far as you can tell, money is a conserved quantity. Of course, the federal government really can create money and so fundamentally this is not a conserved quantity.

A good example of conservation of momentum is recoil which we will look into more details next.

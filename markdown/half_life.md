It used to be that people ate out of radioactive plates. Look below!

### Explanation follow-up

All types of nuclear radiation are probabilistic in nature. We can't tell exactly when its going to happen. But given a large enough sample of material we can predict how many atoms should have decayed by a certain time.

Half-life (Symbol is t½)
------------------------

A half-life is the time it takes for a quantity to fall to half of its value. We usually talk about half-life for radioactive decay, but it really applies to many kinds of unstable situations. For example, if the electron in the hydrogen atom is excited in the level 2 (\(n=2\)), it can decay back to level 1. We don't know when that will happen, it is probabilistic, and we say that this excited electron has some half-life t½.

So for example, lets return to Polonium 208. It is unstable to alpha decay (and then becomes lead Pb 204). The half-life for this process is about 2,900 years. That means that if you have 100 atoms of Polonium 208 and you wait 2,900 years, you should have about 50 atoms of polonium and 50 atoms of lead.

<div class="question">Q. If you wait another 2,900 years, what mix will you probably have?

1. [The other half will change to lead (so 0% of polonium and 100% of lead).](#)**No.** Half-life does not care about what happened in the past.
2. [You will have 1/4 Po and 3/4 Pb.](#)  
  **Correct.** At any given time. The half-life tells you that 1/2 of what you have will decay.
3. [Impossible to tell, its all just luck.](#)**No.** You can tell the probability.
4. [You will have 1/2 Po and 1/2 Pb.](#)**No.** Try again.

- Look at the following [PHET simulation](http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/alpha-decay). In the multiple atoms tab, you can see the distribution of decays around the half-life. Also look at the single atom tab.

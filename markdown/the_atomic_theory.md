<div class="question">Q. Which sentence do you think best describes atoms?

1. [Atoms are the basic pieces of the spacetime tapestry.](#)**No.** There is no relation that we know between atoms and spacetime.
2. [Atoms are the smallest particles in the world](#)**No**, atoms are made of smaller particles themselves.
3. [Atoms are a quantum currency.](#)**No**, I don't know what that is
4. [Atoms are small building blocks of the matter around us.](#)**Correct**! That would be a pretty good description.
5. [All of the above.](#)**No**, some of them are just not true.

Richard Feynman was a great physicist of the 20th century. He was also a good physics teacher and he emphasizes in 1963 that if some cataclysm was to destroy all scientific knowledge, the statement that carries the most information in the least words that we would want send to the next generation might be.

> _“All things are made of atoms--little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another”_

This is the atomic theory.

The Scientific Meaning of the Word Theory 
------------------------------------------

Note that we say atomic **theory** not atomic hypothesis. An hypothesis is an idea that may gives good explanation for physical phenomenon but it still lacks definitive evidence and experimental verification. It is usually no more than an educated guess.

A theory on the other hand has much accumulated evidence. **A theory is a synthesis of many well verified and well tested hypothesis.**

Theories do change, they get refined and sometimes revised quite a bit. Many people thinks this is bad but actually it is the natural process of science. Theory improves overtime. What was true before is still true now but the underlying reason may have changed or the precision in description may have been improved.

- Marie (M): Because theories sometimes do change, many people think that a theory is not be trusted.
- Sophie (S): Yes, I have heard this before. Oh! but its just a theory!
- M: Exactly! Just a theory is a funny statement since scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge that we have. The problem is that the common use of the word theory is to imply that something is unproven or speculative. Exactly the opposite meaning meant by scientists!!
- S: Well they sure choose their wording badly.
- M: Yes they did, in fact its worst because scientists often use the common meaning of the word as well. They usually know the difference but its hard for the general public to know...

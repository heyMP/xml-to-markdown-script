Lesson Objectives
-----------------

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

1. Note the similarities between sound and light given that both phenomena are waves.
2. Determine the result of interference (addition or subtraction) between two waves.
3. Differentiate between single slit interference patterns and double slit interference patterns.
4. Recall that the fundamental wavelength of a standing wave (in a symmetric situation) is twice the size of the system: 2L where L is the size of the system. The system also hosts frequencies that are integer multiples of this corresponding fundamental frequency.

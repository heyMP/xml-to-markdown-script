<span class="s1">Recap of Light.</span>

- <span class="s1">M: Hello, Sophie. I am still here. Let's recap what you have seen about light.</span>
- <span class="s1">S: Hey, Marie, yes it's been pretty weird.</span>

1. <span class="s1">An electromagnetic wave is made of photons. The more intense the light is, the more photons it contains. Each individual photons has an energy given by </span>

<span class="s1">\(E = h f \) with _h_ being Planck's constant.</span>

1. <span class="s1">We can explain the double slit experiment if the intensity of the wave (I) (amplitude squared) gives us the probability of finding photons at that spot. The more intense the wave is, the more chances we have to detect the wave.</span>

<span class="s1">**_The probability of finding a particle at a given point is proportional to the intensity of wave at that point. The more intense the wave, the more probable it is that you will "see" the photon._**</span>

1. <span class="s1">Light interacts with matter on an all-or-nothing basis. We **_never detect_** the electromagnetic wave, we only detect photons. But after having received many, many photons, all of which are being detected where the E&M wave would be more intense, it seems as if we just have a continuous wave.</span>

<span class="s1">â€‹</span><span style="line-height: 20.4px; background-color: initial;">M: The key phrase that will help you remember it is that: "</span>_Light interacts as a particle, the photon, but it moves like a wave_<span style="line-height: 20.4px; background-color: initial;">." The wave tells the photons where they should go (in a probabilistic manner), but every interaction is with one photon at a time.</span>

In lab #1, you showed that the interference pattern from the double slit experiment is evidence of the notion that light must be a wave. The pattern of dark and bright spots that one gets after a light wave goes through a slit or two slits is impossible to explain if light is just made of particles.

Let's look at interference in more details.

Interference
------------

If you have multiple waves in the same medium, you can just superpose them to get the resulting wave. Try this.

<div class="question">Q. If these two waves were moving through water at the same time, what would the water look like?

3. [![](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/waterwavesC.png)](#)**No.** The left pulse should cancel out.
4. [![](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W7photon/waterwavesD.png)](#) **Correct!** The left pulse cancels out, while the right pulse doubles!

</div>Superposition and interference are really synonyms for us (superposition is more general).

Constructive interference occurs when the two waves are exactly in phase (left in Fig. 15) while destructive interference occurs when they are exactly out of phase (right in Fig. 15 below).

<div class="figurelabel"><div class="figurelabel__title">Figure 15</div><div class="figurelabel__desc">Left show constructive interference where the two waves add up in phase. Right show destructive interference when the two waves are exactly out of phase.</div></div>![](https://media.ed.science.psu.edu/sites/media/ed/files/500px-interference_of_two_waves.svg__0.png)

The destructive interference happens when one wave is shifted compared to other by an amount that is half a wavelength.

\(\rm{shift} = \frac{\lambda}{2}\) leads to destructive interference.

Constructive interference is easier, the two waves are exactly in phase and it looks like there is no shift between the two.

When you change the temperature of an object you can alter its state completely either melting it (from solid to liquid, the reverse is freezing), boiling it (from liquid to gas, the reverse is condensing) or ionizing it (from gas to plasma).  
  
Note that during the phase transition (from one state to another), the temperature does not change. If you melt ice, the temperature will stay exactly at 0 ºC (273 K or 32 ºF) for as long as there is ice. Only when the ice is gone, will the water temperature start increasing. The energy pumped in the system during melting is used to break the chemical bonds between the water molecules.  
  
Of all the state of matters, arguably gas is the one that changes the most when the temperature is increased.

- M: Yes, indeed, let's explore that a little bit. But, first, can you answer this question?

<div class="question">Q. When a material is cooled, . . .

1. [it stays the same size](#)**No**, the atoms have less kinetic energy.
2. [it contracts](#)**No.** Almost always correct though If you have less energy for the atoms, they should move less and this almost always leads to contraction, but there are some exceptions, one of which is famous.
3. [it expands](#)**No.** Less kinetic energy when cooled. Why expand?
4. [some material contracts and some expand](#)**Correct!** Most of the time a material contracts if it is cooled, but by how much depends heavily on the material. The length of metal bridges can change a lot and this is why there are grooves on bridges as you can see in the Fig 3. One very important exception to this rule is water. When water freezes and becomes ice, it actually becomes bigger. This has to do with the special structure that the water molecules take when frozen in solid form. This important fact explains why ice floats on water. Solid iron would sink in liquid iron because it is denser. Ice does the opposite. The floating of ice on water is a major factor that allowed life to exist in the first place. It protects life in the ocean and keeps the temperature of the Earth more constant by reflecting the sun’s rays.

This is particularly true for a gas and, interestingly, unlike solids, the change in volume is almost independent of what particular gas it is. All gases, may they be helium or oxygen, change in the same way.

### Demo Warming Balls

In the demo below Prof. Leblond illustrates the change in volume that occurs when a metal is heated.

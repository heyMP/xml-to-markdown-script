You may have heard the term Silicon Valley. It refers to the southern region of the San Francisco Bay area. This region hosts many of the world's biggest tech companies. Nowadays, these companies mostly work on software or internet services, but in its early days it used to be known for all the silicon chips innovators and manufacturers.

Silicon is element 14 on the periodic table of elements, and it is a semiconductor.

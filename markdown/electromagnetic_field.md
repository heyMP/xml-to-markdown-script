An electron that just sits there creates an electric field. How can we get a magnetic field? The answer turns out to be: move the electron.

![wire with current showing the magnetic field going around](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W5electron/Electromagnetism.svg_.png "Fig 3. A current (moving electrons) going thru a wire creates a magnetic field (B) around it.")

The first observation of this phenomenon was done by Oersted in 1820. He observed that the needle of a compass laying on top of a wire move slightly when a current was passing through. There seems to be a magnetic field (denoted B in Fig 3) around the wire but only when the current was on. With no current, there was no magnetic field.

An interesting configuration to set-up is to create a loop of wire in which the electrons are traveling in _a circle_. The loop of wire then behave just like a small bar magnet with a North and South pole. In some sense the electrons are spinning around and the movement creates a magnetic field.

Compare the magnetic field created by a loop of current (a circular wire) (as shown in Fig. 4) to the one of a bar magnet (shown in Fig. 5).

Electromagnet

![nail surrounded by many wires...](https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/phys010/W5electron/nailmagnet.png "Loops of wire with electrons spinning can be used to create a magnet. ")A small loop of current is not much of a magnet but if you have many loops of currents, you can create very powerful magnets. In fact, the most powerful magnets in the world are electromagnets. In Fig. 6, you can see the magnetic field lines created by 5 loops of currents.

This is a side view. The x symbol means the electric current goes into the page while the dot on the other side, that the electric current is coming out of the page. ")

Key point
---------

The main message about magnetism that you should remember is that when an electron moves, the electric field E that it creates changes in time and a

**changing electric field E creates a magnetic field B.**

As it turns out, the reverse is also true. A **changing** **magnetic field B** **creates an** **electric field E.** This is the last key discovery about electricity. It was made by Michael Faraday and it really showed that electricity and magnetism are really linked together into one theory of _electromagnetism_. Here is a short demo about it.

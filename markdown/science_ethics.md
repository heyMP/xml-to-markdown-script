The simple working definition of ethics that we take in this class is  
  
_Ethics is: "The study of the normative values and principles that govern good behavior."_

The three big ethical crimes are

- **Falsification:** There are many ways to falsify data in order to get the result you want, all of which are "scientific crimes." For example, you could trim the data to smooth irregularities and make the data look very accurate and precise. One could "cook" the data: discard some of the results you don't like.
- **Fabrication:** Making up results is a "scientific crime." Somebody who literally forges data by inventing results from experiments that were never performed is committing a "scientific crime."
- **Plagiarism:** The misappropriation of another individual's thoughts, ideas, or writing and claiming them as your own is a "scientific crime."

In science, plagiarism is very serious to the point where self-plagiarism is even frowned upon.

Finally, we have seen a seven steps process (which you do not need to memorize) to analyze an ethical situation. You may be asked to do some ethic spotting and find an ethical issue in a scientific situation.
